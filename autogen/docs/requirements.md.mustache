NetLogo runs on almost any current computer.

If you have any trouble with NetLogo not working, see
[Contacting Us](contact.html).

## Application Requirements

### Windows

NetLogo runs on Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, and Vista. NetLogo 5.2.1 was
the last version to support Windows XP and Windows 2000.

The NetLogo installer for Windows includes Java 8 for NetLogo's private use
only. Other programs on your computer are not affected.

### Mac OS X

Mac OS X 10.8.3 or newer is required. (NetLogo 5.1 was the last version to
support 10.5 and 10.4; NetLogo 5.2.1 was the last version to support 10.6 and
10.7)

The NetLogo application contains a distribution of the Java 8 runtime for
NetLogo's private use only. Other programs on your computer will not be
affected.

### Linux

NetLogo should work on standard Debian-based and Red Hat-based Linux
distributions. The NetLogo tarball includes a copy of the Java 8 runtime.

Start NetLogo by running the provided `NetLogo` executable.

## <a id="threed">3D Requirements</a>

Occasionally an older, less powerful system is not able to use the 3D view or
NetLogo 3D. Try it and see.

Some systems can use 3D but can't switch to full-screen mode. It depends on the
graphics card or controller. (For example, the ATI Radeon IGP 345 and
Intel 82845 probably will not work.)

## 32-bit or 64-bit?
<!-- this needs to be kept in sync with dist/index.html and dist/windows.html -->

For most users on Linux or Windows, the 32-bit version of NetLogo is the
simplest way to a working NetLogo installation. Advanced users will want to
understand the advantages of 64-bit NetLogo as well as how to determine whether
their machine meets the requirements.

The primary advantage of the 64-bit version is the ability to add additional
heap space by changing the "-Xmx" JVM option. For more information, see
[How big can my model be](faq.html#how-big-can-my-model-be-how-many-turtles-patches-procedures-buttons-and-so-on-can-my-model-contain).

To run 64-bit NetLogo, you must be running 64-bit Windows. To determine whether
your version of Windows is 64-bit, see
[Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15056/windows-7-32-64-bit-faq)
if you're using Windows Vista, or Windows 7, or
[Which Windows operating system am I running?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system)
if you are running any other version of Windows.

For Linux users, the easiest way to determine whether your operating system is
64-bit is checking the output of

    uname -m

If the output shows "x86_64" or "amd64", you should be able to run the 64-bit
version.
