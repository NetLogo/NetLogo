## Introduction

NetLogo 7 introduces a new, more powerful way of selecting colors, which
replaces Color Swatches. As was the case previously there are four
different contexts in which colors can be selected: from the Tools menu,
from a Color Input widget, when selecting a plot pen color and when
editing a Note. The ways in which the versions differ involve whether a
selected color can be copied or "picked," whether transparency is
allowed, and what forms of input and output specifications are allowed,
as will be described later.

## Colors in NetLogo

For information on the different ways colors are represented in NetLogo
see the
[Colors](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html#colors)
section of the NetLogo Programming Guide. The NetLogo primitives for
working with colors are
[approximate-hsb](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#approximate-hsb) [approximate-rgb](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#approximate-rgb) [base-colors](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#base-colors) [color](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#color) [extract-hsb](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#extract-hsb) [extract-rgb](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#extract-rgb) [hsb](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#hsb) [import-pcolors](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#import-pcolors) [import-pcolors-rgb](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#import-pcolors-rgb) [pcolor](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#pcolor) [rgb](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#rgb) [scale-color](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#scale-color) [shade-of?](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#shade-of) [wrap-color](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#wrap-color).
The [Palette
Extension](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/palette.html)
offers additional ways to work with colors.

All versions of the Color Picker have two tabs, Simple, and Advanced.
The Simple tab allows users to pick a color from a rectangular grid.
This is analogous to the Color Swatches dialog, although it is more
visually streamlined.

## Simple Tab

The Simple tab of the Color Picker in the Tools menu has buttons to
allow the user to copy the color (icon to the right of the grey
rectangle), or exit the dialog (cancel).

As shown below Simple tab for the Color Input adds a blue 'OK' button to
the right of 'Cancel.' Choosing 'OK' changes the Input to the selected
color, exiting the dialog. 'Copy' puts the NetLogo Color number
corresponding to the selected color in the clipboard. It can then be
copied to the Code Tab, or any other text area. The dialog remains open.
Cancel closes the dialog without changing the color input widget.

When editing a Note, there are four buttons that can be clicked to open
a Color Picker.

The 'Simple' tab of the color picker is the same, regardless of context.
The 'Advanced' tab allows different output formats, depending on the
context.

## The Advanced Tab

### Introduction

The Advanced Tab allows a much more nuanced way to choose a color.

<p><img src="./images/colorpicker/colorpickeradvanced.png"style="width:7in" /></p>

The rainbow slider on the left allows users to select a hue. The slider
to its right allows the user to select the transparency of the color. By
default, the color is fully opaque, and the knob is at the top of the
slider, moving it down makes the color more transparent. You can also drag the small circle in the rectangle to the right
of the sliders to quickly explore variants of the selected hue. Moving from it
from left to right (horizontally) increases the saturation. Moving it bottom to top
(vertically) increases the lightness.

### Input Format

A powerful feature of the Advanced tab is that you can import colors
using the following common formats RGB, RGBA, HSB, HSBA, HSL, HSLA and
hexadecimal as well as NetLogo Number or NetLogo word. Use the Input
Format pulldown menu to select the format and you will be able to set
the appropriate value(s). The pulldown menu below shows the output
options, which have the acronyms above spelled out. There follow two
examples of specifying an input. For a NetLogo word there is a text
field. For HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) there are three numeric
fields. The color selected using the Input format can then be modified
by using the hue slider, transparency slider or the palette rectangle.

<p><img src="./images/colorpicker/colorpickerinputformatchoices.png"/></p>

In this example the input is a NetLogo word.

<p><img src="./images/colorpicker/colorpickerinputformatNLword.png"/></p>

In this example the input is HSB.

### Output Format

The color that results after any adjustments can be output in the
selected Output Format. The full list of output formats is NetLogo
Number, NetLogo word and RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha). However in some
contexts only a NetLogo Number can be output. As the user changes a
color the value of the Input value is updated. In the image below it was
initially lime - 0.3, but changed to lime - 0.6

<p><img src="./images/colorpicker/colorpickerNLwordinputRGBAoutput.png"style="width:7in" /></p>

### Output Formats for Different Contexts

For the Color Input and plot pen colors the output format is a NetLogo
number. Transparency is not supported for the Color Input in this
release, but may be available in the future.

For Notes the output format is RGBA.

For the Tools menu Color Picker the output formats are NetLogo number,
NetLogo word and RGBA.

### Details about RGB Output

There is no explicit RGB output format. However when you select "RGBA",
and your color is opaque (maximum alpha), the result is RGB format - a
3-item list (no alpha). Otherwise "RGBA" output produces a 4-item list
(with alpha). In the example below you can see that the output is a
3-item list, because there is no transparency and RGBA output is
selected.

### Details about the Alpha Bar

Some users may want to skip this section on first reading. The "alpha"
bar of the Advanced tab is used to adjust the transparency of a color.
If neither the input format nor the output format allows transparency
the alpha bar will be hidden. The formats that do not allow transparency
are: NetLogo number, NetLogo word RGB, HSB, and HSL. If the input
supports alpha, but the output does not, the output dropdown will be
highlighted and will have a tooltip that explains that the output color
will be opaque. The first example shows the case where there is no alpha
bar. The second example show the highlighted output because there is
transparency, but an opaque output format.
