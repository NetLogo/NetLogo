Many models created in earlier versions of NetLogo also work in NetLogo 5.0.
However, some models will need changes. If an old model isn't working, this
section of the User Manual may be able to help you.

What issues may arise depends on what version of NetLogo the model was created
with.

This guide only covers changes most likely to cause issues for users. See the
[release notes](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Release-notes) for more
complete details on differences between versions.

[TOC]

## Changes for NetLogo 6.1.0

### CF Extension Removal

The CF extension is no longer bundled with NetLogo.  The multi-conditional
`cf:ifelse` and `cf:ifelse-value` primitives are now now supported directly
in NetLogo without an extension by [[ifelse]] and [[ifelse-value]].  Simply
remove the `cf:` from the primitives in your models and they should work
as they did before with CF.

## Changes for NetLogo 6.0.3

### Arduino Extension Changes

The `arduino` extension has substantially changed the way it receives values from
Arduino boards. Please consult the arduino example sketch (included within
the "models" folder under Chapter 8 of the IABM textbook) for an updated sketch
compatible with the Arduino example model. If you have an existing arduino
sketch, you will need to adjust the format used to send values to NetLogo.
Old sketches will have code which sends back messages like ";A,2.5;". For the
new version of the `arduino` extension to receive the same message, sketches
should send ";A,D,2.5;" instead. The added 'D,' informs Netlogo that
the value being sent is a number and not a string.

### CF Extension Changes

All primitives have been removed from the `cf` extension and replaced by the `cf:ifelse` and
`cf:ifelse-value` multi-branch primitives. We encourage existing `cf` users to
adjust their code to use these new primitives. Over time, we hope to use these primitives
as an example on which to remodel NetLogo's existing `ifelse` and `ifelse-value`
primitives. Because this would be a relatively large language change, we would love
to hear any [feedback address](mailto:ccl-feedback@ccl.northwestern.edu) you may
have from using these `cf` extension primitives.

## Changes for NetLogo 6.0

### Tasks replaced by Anonymous Procedures

In NetLogo 6.0, tasks have been replaced by anonymous procedures. This means
that `task` is no longer a primitive, it's been replaced by the new
[arrow syntax](dictionary.html#arrow) for creating anonymous procedures.
Similarly, question mark variables like `?`, `?1`, and `?2` are now just
ordinary names in NetLogo and can be used to name procedure variables, let
variables, or anonymous procedure variables. Finally, `is-reporter-task?` and
`is-command-task?` have been replaced by `is-anonymous-reporter?` and
`is-anonymous-command?`.

To make this transition easier, we've added an automatic conversion step which
should allow most models saved in NetLogo 5 to be converted to use the new
syntax automatically. The autoconverter has been a substantial piece of effort
and we've tested it on all the models in the models library. To use it, ensure
the model compiles and run properly in NetLogo 5 or later, then save it from
NetLogo 5 or later. Then, simply open the model in NetLogo 6. If all goes well,
you'll see the converter has changed code like `task [?1 + ?2]` to
`[ [?1 ?2] -> ?1 + ?2 ]`. The question marks are meant to serve as temporary
placeholders for conversion. They enable your model to run, but you can (and
should) replace these variables with meaningful names. If you open a model with
tasks and it has *not* been converted, the autoconverter wasn't able to convert
your model. Rather than attempt to autoconvert your model and break something,
the model will open, you will be shown the appropriate errors and given a chance
to edit your model.

While we have tested the autoconverter thoroughly, we expect there to be some
cases it doesn't cover.

- If you make use of extensions that aren't yet compiled for NetLogo 6, the
  autoconverter will not work until those extensions have been updated.
- If your code uses `run` or `runresult` to evaluate strings containing tasks,
  the autoconverter will not change those strings to be anonymous procedures.
  To make `run` and `runresult` work as expected, look at strings in your model
  and change any which rely on `task` or `?`-variables to instead rely on
  anonymous procedures

If your model doesn't fall into the above categories and doesn't convert or
converts incorrectly, please email our
[feedback address](mailto:ccl-feedback@ccl.northwestern.edu) and we'll be happy
to offer whatever assistance we can.

### Link reporters overhauled to be more consistent and flexible

In previous versions of NetLogo, link reporters have had a number of
inconsistencies regarding directed and undirected links. For example, `my-links`
would report *all* links connected to a turtle, whereas `link-neighbors` would
only report neighbors connected by *undirected* links. Furthermore, it was quite
difficult to work with models where the links could either be directed or
undirected.

To alleviate these issues, the link primitives have been overhauled in 6.0.
These changes only affect existing models that use both directed and undirected
links while also using the unbreeded link primitives.

The changes are as follows:

- Link reporters that contain the word "out" now utilize both directed, outgoing
  links and undirected links. That is, they now specify links that can be used
  to get from the current node to other nodes. For example, `out-link-neighbor?`
  will report `true` if the current turtle is connected to the given turtle by
  either an outgoing directed link or an undirected link. If you only want
  directed, outgoing links, you can use a breed-specific reporter or
  `my-out-links with [ is-directed? self ]`. Generally, when working with models
  that have both directed and undirected links, you will probably want to use
  the "out" primitives for most things now.
- Link reporters that contain the word "in" now utilize both directed, incoming
  links and undirected links. That is, they now specify links that can be used
  to get to the current node from other nodes. For example, `in-link-neighbor?`
  will report `true` if the current turtle is connected to the given turtle by
  either an incoming directed link or an undirected link. If you only want
  directed, incoming links, you can use a breed-specific reporter or
  `my-in-links with [ is-directed? self ]`.
- Link reporters that do not specify "out" or "in" utilize *all* links.

Furthermore, there are no longer restrictions regarding which reporters can be
used with which breeds. For unbreeded links, this makes it possible to use the
same primitives regardless of whether your network ends up being directed or
undirected.

The new behavior (including all changed primitives) is summarized by the
following table, where "un" refers to undirected links, "out" refers to
directed, outgoing links, and "in" refers to directed, incoming links.

##### New link reporter behavior

### Removal of Applets

Oracle, the company behind Java, has announced that Java applets are deprecated
(see
[this blog post](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/moving_to_a_plugin_free)
for more information). This comes as the major browsers have removed support for
plug-ins (like java applets) or announced that they plan to do so.

Instead of using applets to distribute your model, NetLogo offers the option to
export to NetLogo Web. While NetLogo Web doesn't yet offer the full
functionality of desktop NetLogo (in particular, extensions aren't supported),
it is now capable of running most of the models in the NetLogo models library
and we hope that most model distributors will find that it meets their needs. To
export to NetLogo Web, choose the "Save As NetLogo Web" option from the "File"
menu.

### Changes to the NetLogo User Interface

Users will notice several tweaks to the NetLogo User interface when opening
NetLogo 6 for the first time. We've removed the bar border above the view. To
open the 3D View in 6.0, you can right click on the view and choose "Switch to
3D View", or choose the same option from the "Tools" menu. Ticks are now
displayed in the interface tab toolbar beneath the speed slider. To adjust the
label used for "ticks" and other view properties, you can choose the "Settings"
button at the far right of the interface tab toolbar or right-click on the view
and choose "Edit..." from the context menu that appears.

### Nobody Not Permitted as a Chooser Value

In NetLogo 6.0, `nobody` is no longer a valid chooser value. Just as you can't
put `turtle 0` or `turtles`, `nobody` refers to a non-literal value which isn't
supported in choosers. As part of this transition, choosers containing `nobody`
(or `nobody` within a nested list) will have all uses of `nobody` changed to
`"nobody"` when opened in NetLogo 6.0.

### Breeds must have singular and plural names

In NetLogo 6.0, you must specify both plural and singular breed names. In prior
versions, declarations like `breed [mice]` were legal, but this support has been
removed in 6.0. If you have models which use only plural breed names, it is
recommended that you convert them to specify both names before opening in 6.0
since doing so will permit the NetLogo converter to work most effectively on any
other code in your model which needs conversion.

### Removal of "Movie" Prims

The NetLogo movie prims hadn't been updated in quite some time and generated
invalid quicktime movie files. They have been replaced by prims in the new `vid`
extension. The full documentation for the `vid` extension is available in the
[Vid Extension](vid.html) section of the manual. As with all extensions, users
will need to include `vid` in the `extensions` section of their NetLogo model.

Many of the movie primitives have direct parallels in the `vid` extension which
can be found in the following table:

movie prim | vid prim
---------- | --------
`movie-cancel` | `vid:reset-recorder`
`movie-close`  | `vid:save-recording *file-name*`
`movie-grab-view` | `vid:record-view`
`movie-grab-interface` | `vid:record-interface`
`movie-start *file-name*` | `vid:start-recorder *optional-width* *optional-height*`
`movie-status` | `vid:recorder-status`

When you first open a file in NetLogo 6.0, your file will be automatically
converted to use the new primitives. This will include adding a new global
variable - `_recording-save-file-name` to track the name of the active
recording, as well as adding the `vid` extension to the model. You should verify
that the conversion took place correctly. There is no replacement for
`movie-set-frame-rate`. The vid extension records frames at 25 per second,
slightly more than the default 15 frames-per-second of the movie prims. If your
recording is sensitive to framerate, consider recording each existing frame
twice (2/25 is fairly close to 1/15) or consider using a postprocessing tool
(like gstreamer or ffmpeg) to adjust the video playback speed.

### Improved Name Collision Detection

In NetLogo 6.0, expanded error-checking in the NetLogo compiler causes models
which define `undirected-link-breed [ undirected-links undirected-link ]` and/or
`directed-link-breed [ directed-links directed-link ]` to error for redefining a
primitive reporter (either `is-directed-link?` or `is-undirected-link?`). If
your model doesn't use `is-directed-link?` or `is-undirected-link?` at all,
simply changing the breed names should resolve the error.

If you used either of the `is-<directedness>-link?` prim, there are several ways
you might modify your model to account for this change. If your model has no
other breeded links, consider removing the link breed and using the built-in
link primitives. If your model has other breeded links, but only of different
directedness, simply changing the breed name (and all related primitive names)
should resolve the problem. Note that in this case `is-directed-link?` and/or
`is-undirected-link?` continue to behave the same as before. If your model has
other breeded links of the same directedness, the change will vary depending on
your model. The breed name(s) must be changed, but you must decide whether you
used `is-directed-link?` / `is-undirected-link?` to check link directedness or
to check that link breed membership. If you used it to check link directedness
leaving it as-is should keep the current behavior of the model. Otherwise, it
can simply be replaced by `is-<breed>?`.

### Removal of `hubnet-set-client-interface`

The `hubnet-set-client-interface` primitive was rendered obsolete by the
introduction of the HubNet client editor and end of support for calculator
HubNet. We have found it used in very few models and have decided to remove it
from the language. On opening an existing model in 6.0, the autoconverter should
remove all uses of `hubnet-set-client-interface` from your code.

### Improved & Updated Extensions API

One of our goals in NetLogo 6.0 has been to make it easier to develop extensions
and easy to develop more *powerful* extensions. To that end, we've bumped the
extension API from 5.0 to 6.0. Existing extensions will need to recompile
changing the "NetLogo-Extension-API-Version" in their jar's MANIFEST.MF from 5.0
to 6.0.

Some of the changes we've made to the extensions API include:

- `org.nlogo.api.Context` now allows access to the current world and workspace
  objects without requiring a cast to an `org.nlogo.nvm.ExtensionContext`.
- `org.nlogo.api.Workspace` has been introduced as a stable API for extensions
  to depend on.
- A NetLogo jar is now available from BinTray.

For a full list of changes between 5.0 and 6.0, please visit our
[Extension Transition Guide](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Hexy-Extension-Transition-Guide)
on GitHub.

In service of making it easier to build extensions, we've expanded and improved
the
[NetLogo Extension Plugin](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo-Extension-Plugin)
for [`sbt`](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), the Scala Build Tool. Sbt is a powerful
tool for building JVM projects and can be used in projects that use Scala, Java,
or a combination of the two. We're now using the Extension Plugin to build all
of the bundled extensions and we strongly recommend extension authors take
advantage of the plugin as it makes configuring a NetLogo extension build
extremely straightforward. The plugin handles fetching the NetLogo jar which
extensions compile against as well as generation of a jar for the extension
containing the appropriate metadata.

### Add `range` primitive

A new `range` primitive was added in NetLogo 6. As "range" may appear in
existing models as a procedure or variable name, we have added an autoconversion
step which will ensure that these models continue to operate immediately upon
opening in NetLogo 6. Existing uses of `range` in models authored before
NetLogo 6 will be converted to `_range` upon first opening in NetLogo 6. Once
the model opens, you can rename `_range` to suit your model.

## Changes for NetLogo 5.2

### hsb primitives

In 5.2, the hsb primitives have been changed to work with the standard scale
values of 360 for hue, and 100 for saturation and brightness. This affects the
primitives `hsb`, `extract-hsb` and `approximate-hsb`.

The old primitives, scaled to 255, are automatically transitioned to and have
been renamed `__hsb-old`, `__extract-hsb-old` and `__approximate-hsb-old`.

### GoGo extension

The GoGo extension has been upgraded to use newer GoGo boards with the HID
interface.  Many of the older primitives no longer work, and will alert you to
upgrading your GoGo board's firmware.

If you need to continue to use a serial interface, you can use the bundled
gogo-serial extension.  Change your model to use gogo-serial as opposed to gogo.
More details [here](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/GoGo-Upgrade).

If you cannot upgrade to use the new HID extension nor the new serial extension,
the original extension can be found at
https://github.com/NetLogo/GoGo-RXTX-Extension

## Changes for NetLogo 5.0

### Plotting

In 5.0, you don't have to put your plotting code in the Code tab anymore.
Instead, you can put it inside the plots themselves, in the Interface tab.

Nonetheless, the old style and all of the existing plotting primitives are still
supported. We recommend changing your model to use the new style, but if you
don't, it should still work.

The following example shows how to change a model to use the new style. Suppose
you have a typical NetLogo 4.1 model with one plot called "populations" and two
pens called "robots" and "humans". The old code might look like:

    to setup
      clear-all
      ...
      do-plotting
    end

    to go
      ...
      tick
      do-plotting
    end

    to do-plotting
      set-current-plot "populations"
      set-current-plot-pen "robots"
      plot count robots
      set-current-plot-pen "humans"
      plot count humans
    end

Here are the steps to make the transition:

- Copy the `plot count robots` command and paste it into the Update Commands
  field for the robots pen in the plot edit dialog. Remove it from the
  `do-plotting` procedure.
- The `plot count humans` command can be moved in the same way for the humans
  pen.
- After those lines are removed from the `do-plotting` procedure, it doesn't
  actually do anything anymore! Remove it.
- The final step is to replace the `do-plotting` procedure calls in `setup` and
  `go`. In `setup`, the `do-plotting` call should be changed to `reset-ticks`.
  In `go`, the do-plotting call should be changed to `tick`. `reset-ticks` and
  `tick` will both cause plotting to happen automatically.

The resulting (much simpler) code looks like this:

    to setup
      clear-all
      ...
      reset-ticks
    end

    to go
      ...
      tick
    end

For more details on how plotting works in NetLogo 5.0, see the Plotting Sections
of the Programming Guide and the Interface Guide. For details on how plotting
interacts with the tick counter, read on.

### Tick counter

The way the tick counter works has changed in 5.0. Instead of being initially
set to 0, the tick counter is initially blank.

#### `reset-ticks`

You must use `reset-ticks` to start the tick counter at 0 before using `ticks`,
`tick` or `tick-advance` for the first time.

`reset-ticks` should go at the end of your setup procedure. Putting it there
will allow your model to work with 5.0's new plotting features.

#### `reset-ticks` and plotting

In 5.0, you don't have to put your plotting code in the Code tab anymore.
Instead, you can put it inside the plots themselves, in the Interface tab. Code
inside plots is triggered by `reset-ticks` and `tick`. Resetting the tick
counter runs plot setup code, and then it also runs plot update code to plot the
initial state of the model. The initial state of the model won't be in place
until the end of `setup`, so that's why `reset-ticks` should go at the end.

#### `__clear-all-and-reset-ticks`

In order for models from previous NetLogo versions to work in 5.0 without
changes, when an old model is opened in 5.0, any occurrences of `clear-all` (or
`ca`) are automatically changed to `__clear-all-and-reset-ticks`, which combines
the effects of `clear-all` and `reset-ticks`. The two underscores on the name
indicate that this is not a normal primitive, but exists only for backwards
compatibility.

You should remove `__clear-all-and-reset-ticks` from your code, replace it with
`clear-all`, and put `reset-ticks` at the end of your setup procedure. (This
doesn't happen automatically because the structure of NetLogo models is too
free-form for an automatic converter to reliably make the change for you.)

### Unicode characters

NetLogo 5.0 fully supports international characters cross-platform, using the
Unicode character set. NetLogo 5.0 model files always represent Unicode
characters using the UTF-8 encoding.

Previous versions of NetLogo allowed Unicode characters to be used in some
contexts. However, model files were saved in the platform's default encoding,
which on most systems was something other than UTF-8. Characters were handled
correctly on the same platform (e.g. two Windows machines), but could be altered
if the model was moved between platforms (e.g. from Windows to Mac or vice
versa).

When opening an existing model in NetLogo 5.0, if the model contains
international or other non-ASCII characters, the characters may be interpreted
incorrectly, because they were originally written in a platform-specific
encoding, but then read back in in UTF-8.

If only a few characters are affected, you might find it easiest just to fix
them manually.

But if you expect a large number of characters to be affected, and you want them
translated automatically, you can use a third party utility to re-encode your
.nlogo file from its original encoding into UTF-8. After conversion, open the
model in NetLogo 5.0 and all characters should be correct.

### Info tabs

NetLogo 5.0 uses the Markdown markup language to allow you to format your Info
tab, including headers, bold and italics, images, and so forth.

Earlier versions of NetLogo used a custom markup language with much more limited
capabilities.

When opening a model from an older version, NetLogo 5.0 translates your old
markup into Markdown. Most of the time this produces good results, but you may
want to check the results yourself and make sure that your Info tab still looks
good.

### Model speed

In NetLogo 5.0 every model has a "target frame rate" which affects the default
speed at which the model runs, when the speed slider is in the middle, on the
"normal speed" setting.

The default target frame rate for new models, and for models that were created
in earlier versions of NetLogo, is 30 frames per second. If you are using
tick-based updates, as we recommend for most models, then that translates to 30
ticks per second.

If your model runs slower in 5.0 than it ran in 4.1, it's probably just because
its speed is being limited by this rate. If you want, you can press the Settings
button in the Interface tab and change the frame rate to a higher number.

Some old models used the `every` command to set a default speed. In most case
this can be now removed from the code, and the target frame rate setting used
instead.

### List performance

The underlying data structure for NetLogo lists has changed.

In NetLogo 4.1, a NetLogo list was represented internally as a singly linked
list. Some operations on singly linked lists are fast (such as `first` and
`butfirst`) but others are slow because they could require traversing the whole
list (such as `item` and `last`).

In NetLogo 5.0, lists are now actually trees internally. As a result, some
operations are a little slower, but other operations are drastically faster on
long lists. See the
[Lists section of the Programming Guide](programming.html#lists) for details.

Some models may run a little slower with the new data structure, especially if
you make heavy use of short lists. But other models will run faster -- perhaps
dramatically faster.

Some special ways of writing list-processing code that were useful in
NetLogo 4.1 are no longer needed in 5.0. For example, since in 4.1 `fput` was
fast and `lput` was slow, modelers sometimes built up lists in reverse order
using `fput`, perhaps calling `reverse` later to restore the intended order. In
NetLogo 5.0, you don't need to code that way anymore. `fput` and `lput` are the
same speed.

### Extensions API

If you are the author of an extension, you will need to recompile it against the
5.0 NetLogo.jar and lib directory for it to work with 5.0.

You may also need to be aware of the following changes:

#### Syntax constants

The code for specifying the syntax of a primitive has changed slightly, for
example `Syntax.TYPE_STRING` is now `Syntax.StringType()`. (From Java, the pair
of parentheses at the end is required. In Scala, you can omit them.)

#### LogoList construction

One significant change is that `org.nlogo.api.LogoList` no longer has a public
constructor. Instead, there are two new ways to construct a `LogoList`.

If you have a `java.lang.Iterable`, you can copy the contents into a fresh
`LogoList` by passing it to the static method `LogoList.fromJava()`. See the
array extension source code for a sample usage.

Or, to build up a new list one item a time, use `org.nlogo.api.LogoListBuilder`.
The [Extensions Guide](extensions.html) has sample code showing the use of
`LogoListBuilder`.

#### Primitive classes

In prior NetLogo versions, the extensions API required that each extension
primitive have its own separate top-level class with a no-argument constructor.
These limitations have now been lifted. Also, api.Primitive objects are now made
only once, when the extension is loaded, instead of every time the Code tab was
recompiled.

## Changes for NetLogo 4.1

### Combining `set` and `of`

The following syntax is no longer supported:

    set [<variable>] of <agent> <value>

Commands of this form must be rewritten using `ask`:

    ask <agent> [ set <variable> <value> ]

Or, if the new value must be computed by the asking agent and not by the agent
whose variable is being set:

    ;; OPTION #1 (using let):
    let new-value <value>
    ask <agent> [ set <variable> new-value ]

    ;; OPTION #2 (using myself):
    ask <agent> [ set <variable> [value] of myself ]

So for example, this:

    set [color] of turtle 0 red

Can be rewritten as:

    ask turtle 0 [ set color red ]

It is not necessary to use `let` or `myself` since red is red from the point of
view of both agents.

However, this:

    set [color] of turtle 0 color

Must be rewritten as:

    let new-color color
    ask turtle 0 [ set color new-color ]

or

    ask turtle 0 [ set color [color] of myself ]

in order not to change the meaning, since the two agents may have different
starting values for `color`. The form using `myself` is briefer, but the former
using `let` may be considered clearer, depending on context and individual
preference.

## Changes for NetLogo 4.0

### Who numbering

Prior to NetLogo 4.0, a dead turtle's who number (stored in the [[who]] turtle
variable) could be reassigned to a later newborn turtle. In NetLogo 4.0, who
numbers are never reused until who numbering is reset to 0 by the [[clear-all]]
or [[clear-turtles]] command. This change in behavior may break a few old
models.

### Turtle creation: randomized vs. "ordered"

NetLogo 4.0 provides two different observer commands for creating turtles,
[[create-turtles]] ([[crt|create-turtles]]) and
[[create-ordered-turtles]] ([[cro|create-ordered-turtles]]).

`crt` gives the new turtles random colors and random integer headings. `cro`
assigns colors sequentially and gives the turtles sequential equally spaced
headings, with the first turtle facing north (heading of 0).

Prior to NetLogo 4.0, the `crt` command behaved the way `cro` does now. If your
old model depends on the "ordered" behavior, you will need to change your code
to use `cro` instead of `crt`.

It is common for old models that used `crt` to contain extra commands to
randomize the new turtles' headings, for example `rt random 360` or `set heading
random 360`. These commands are no longer necessary when used inside `crt`.

### Adding strings and lists

Prior to NetLogo 4.0, the [[+|Symbols]] (addition) operator could be used to
concatenate strings and join lists. In current NetLogo, `+` only works on
numbers. To concatenate strings, use the [[word]] primitive; to join lists
together, use the [[sentence]] primitive. This language change was made to
increase the speed of code that uses `+`.

Old code:

    print "There are " + count turtles + " turtles."

New code:

    print (word "There are " count turtles " turtles.")

Likewise, if you need to concatenate lists, use SENTENCE.

This change is not handled automatically when converting old models; users will
need to change their code by hand.

We know this change will be awkward for users who are used to the old syntax. We
have made this change for efficiency and consistency. We can implement an
addition operator that only adds numbers much more efficiently than one that
handles several different data types. Because addition is such a common
operation, NetLogo's overall speed is affected.

### The `-at` primitives

The observer may no longer use [[patch-at]], [[turtles-at]], and
[[BREEDS-at|turtles-at]]. Use [[patch]], [[turtles-on]] `patch`, and
[[BREEDS-on|turtles-on]] `patch` instead. Note that `patch` now rounds its
inputs (before it only accepted integer inputs).

### Links

NetLogo 3.1 had supports for using links to connect turtles to make networks,
graphs, and geometric figures. The links were themselves turtles.

In NetLogo 4.0, instead of links being turtles, links are now an independent
fourth agent type, right alongside observer, turtles, patches. The primitives
involving links are no longer considered experimental; they are now fully part
of the language.

Models that use the old, experimental turtle-based link primitives will need to
be updated to use link agents. The differences are not huge, but hand updating
is required.

Links are documented in the [Links](programming.html#links) section of the
Programming Guide, and in the NetLogo Dictionary entries for the link
primitives. See the Networks section of the Models Library for example models
that use links. There are also some link-based Code Examples.

First you will need to remove any breeds called "links" if you are only using
one type of links then you will not have to use breeds at all. If you are using
multiple types of links see [[undirected-link-breed]] and
[[directed-link-breed]]. Commands and reporters that contain the word "links"
(like `__create-links-with`, etc.) will automatically be converted to the new
form without underscores ([[create-links-with|create-link]]).
However, primitives that use a different breed name (such as "edges") will not
be converted. You will need to remove the underscores by hand and unless you are
declaring a link breed with that name you will need to change the breed
designation to "links".

The commands `remove-link(s)-with/from/to` no longer exist. Instead you should
ask the links in question to [[die]].

For example:

    ask turtle 0 [ __remove-links-with link-neighbors ]

becomes

    ask turtle 0 [ ask my-links [ die ] ]

Several of the layout commands have slightly different inputs, the first two
inputs are generally a turtle agentset and a link agentset to perform the layout
on. See the dictionary entries for details. [[layout-spring]], [[layout-radial]]
and [[layout-tutte]]

You may also need to rearrange the declaration of turtles-own variables, since
links were once actually turtles. Any variables that apply to links should be
moved into a [[links-own]] block.

Since links are no longer turtles they no longer have the built-in turtle
variables (though some of the link variables are the same such as [[color]] and
[[label]]. If you formerly used the location of link turtles you will now need
to calculate the midpoint of the link. This is fairly simple in a non-wrapping
world.

    to-report link-xcor
      report mean [xcor] of both-ends
    end

    to-report link-ycor
      report mean [ycor] of both-ends
    end

it is a little bit trickier in a wrapping world but still fairly
straightforward.

    to-report link-xcor
      let other-guy end2
      let x 0
      ask end1
      [
        hatch 1
        [
          face other-guy
          fd [distance other-guy] of myself / 2
          set x xcor
          die
        ]
      ]
      report x
    end

and similarly for `ycor`.

If you used either the size or heading of the link turtles you can use the
reporters [[link-length]] and [[link-heading]] instead.

### New "of" syntax

We have replaced three different language constructs, `-of` (with hyphen),
`value-from`, and `values-from` with a single [[of]] construct (no hyphen).
<table border>
<tr>
  <th>old
  <th>new
<tr>
  <td>`color-of turtle 0`
  <td>`[color] of turtle 0`
<tr>
  <td>`value-from turtle 0 [size * size]`
  <td>`[size * size] of turtle 0`
<tr>
  <td>`mean values-from turtles [size]`
  <td>`mean [size] of turtles`
</table>

When `of` is used with a single agent, it reports a single value. When used with
an agentset, it reports a list of values (in random order, since agentsets are
always in random order).

Note that when opening old models in the new version, `-of`, `value-from`, and
`values-from` will automatically be converted to use "of" instead, but some
nested uses of these constructs are too complex for the converter and must be
converted by hand.

### Serial `ask`

The [[ask]] command is now serial rather than concurrent. In other words, the
asked agents will run one at a time. Not until one agent completely finishes the
entire body of the `ask` does the next agent start.

Note that even the old [[ask]] was never truly concurrent; we simulated
concurrent execution by interleaving execution among the agents using a
turn-taking mechanism described in the NetLogo FAQ.

We have made this change because in our experience, users often wrote models
that behaved in unexpected ways due to the simulated concurrency, but rarely
wrote models that benefited from the simulated concurrency. Models exhibiting
unexpected behavior could usually be fixed by adding the
[[without-interruption]] command in the right places, but it was difficult for
users to know whether that command was needed and if so, where.

In NetLogo 4.0, [[without-interruption]] is no longer necessary unless your
model uses [[ask-concurrent]] (or a turtle or patch forever button containing
code that depends on simulated concurrency). In most models, all uses of
`without-interruption` can be removed.

The simulated concurrency formerly employed by "ask" is still accessible in
three ways:

- You may use the [[ask-concurrent]] primitive instead of [[ask]] to get the old
  simulated concurrency. (We don't recommend this, though.)
- Commands issued in the Command Center directly to turtles, patches, or links
  have an implied `ask-concurrent`.
- Turtle, patch, and link forever buttons have an implied `ask-concurrent` as
  well.

Note that `ask` itself is always serial regardless of the context in which it is
used, however.

In our own Models Library, models that make use of this concurrency are rare. A
prominent example, though, is Termites, which uses a concurrent turtle forever
button.

### Tick counter

NetLogo now has a built-in tick counter for representing the passage of
simulated time.

You advance the counter by one using the [[tick]] command. If you need to read
its value, there's a reporter called [[ticks]]. The [[clear-all]] command resets
the tick counter; so does [[reset-ticks]].

In most models the tick counter will be integer-valued, but if you want to use
smaller increments of time, you can use the [[tick-advance]] command to advance
the tick counter by any positive amount, including fractional amounts. Some
Models Library models that use `tick-advance` are Vector Fields and the GasLab
models.

The value of the tick counter is displayed in the toolbar at the top of the
Interface tab. (You can use the Settings... button in the toolbar to hide the
tick counter, or change the word "ticks" to something else.)

### View update modes

In the past, NetLogo always tried to update the view about 20 times a second.
We're now calling that "continuous" view updates. The biggest problem with it
was that you usually want updates to happen between model ticks, not in the
middle of a tick, so we had a checkbox on buttons that (by default) forced a
display update after every button iteration. That made sure updates happened
between ticks, but it didn't get rid of the intermediate updates. You had to use
[[no-display]] and [[display]] to lock them out.

We still support continuous updates. They are the default when you start up
NetLogo. But most Models Library models now use tick-based updates. With
tick-based updates, updates happen only when the tick counter advances. (The
[[display]] command can be used to force additional
updates; see below.)

The advantages of tick-based updates as we see them are as follows:

1. Consistent, predictable view update behavior which does not vary from
   computer to computer or from run to run.
2. Intermediate updates can confuse the user of your model by letting them see
   things they aren't supposed to see, which may be misleading.
3. Increased speed. Updating the view takes time, so if one update per tick is
   enough, then enforcing than there is only one update per tick will make your
   model faster.
4. Instead of having a "force view update" checkbox in every button like in
   NetLogo 3.1, we only need one choice which applies to the entire model.
5. Using the speed slider to slow down a model now just inserts pauses between
   ticks. So with tick-based updates, `setup` buttons are no longer affected by
   the speed slider. This was a real annoyance with the old speed slider. (The
   annoyance persists for models that use continuous updates, though.)

As mentioned above, most models in our Models Library now use tick-based
updates.

Even for models that would normally be set to tick-based updates, it may be
useful to switch to continuous updates temporarily for debugging purposes.
Seeing what's going on within a tick, instead of only seeing the end result of a
tick, could help with troubleshooting.

If you switch your model to use tick-based updates, you'll also need to add the
[[tick]] command to your code, otherwise the view won't
update. (Note that the view still always updates when a button pops up or a
command entered in the command center finishes, though. So it's not like the
view will just stay frozen indefinitely.)

#### How to make a model use ticks and tick-based updates

Here are the steps to follow to convert your model to use ticks and tick-based
updates in NetLogo 4.0:

1. In the Interface tab toolbar, on the right hand side where it says "update
   view:", change the setting from "continuously" to "on ticks".
2. Add the [[tick]] command to your go procedure, at or near the end. In Models
   Library models we always put `tick` after the agents move but before any
   plotting commands. That's because the plotting commands might contain
   something like `plotxy ticks ...` and we want the new value of the tick
   counter used, not the old one. Most models don't refer to the tick counter in
   their plotting commands, but nonetheless, for consistency and to avoid
   mistakes we suggest always putting `tick` before the plotting commands.

Some models will require some additional changes:

1. If your model already has a global "ticks" or "clock" or "time" variable, get
   rid of it. Use the [[tick]] command and [[ticks]] reporter instead. (If your
   model uses fractional increments of time, use [[tick-advance]] instead of
   `tick`.) If you had a monitor for that variable, you can get rid of it;
   there's now a tick counter in the toolbar.
2. [[clear-all]] resets the tick counter to zero. If you don't use `clear-all`
   in your setup procedure, then you may need to add [[reset-ticks]] to reset
   the counter to zero.
3. If you used [[no-display]] and [[display]] to prevent view updates from
   happening in the middle of go, you can get rid of them.
4. If your model needs to update the view without advancing the tick counter
   (examples: Party, Dice Stalagmite, network models with animated layout,
   models with mouse interaction buttons), use the [[display]] command to force
   additional view updates so the user can see what is going on.

### Speed slider

Previous versions of NetLogo had a speed slider that could be used to make
models run slower, so you can see what's going on.

In NetLogo 4.0, the slider can be used to speed up models as well. It does this
by updating the view less frequently. Updating the view takes time, so the fewer
updates, the faster the model runs.

The default position of the slider is in the center. When you're at the center,
the slider says "normal speed".

As you move the slider away from the center position, the model will gradually
run faster or slower.

At very high speeds, view updates become very infrequent and may be separated by
several seconds. It may feel like the model is actually running slower, since
the updates are so infrequent. But watch the tick counter, or other indicators
such as plots, and you'll see that yes, the model really is running faster. If
the infrequent updates are disconcerting, don't push the slider so far over.

When using tick-based updates, slowing the model down does not cause additional
view updates. Rather, NetLogo simply pauses after each tick.

When using continuous updates, slowing the model down means view updates become
more closely spaced. If you push the speed slider more than halfway to the left,
the model will be running so slowly that you can watch turtles moving one at a
time! This is new in NetLogo 4.0; in previous NetLogo versions, no matter how
slowly you ran a model, you would never see the agents in an `ask` moving one at
a time; all the agents in an `ask` always appeared to move together.

### Numbers

NetLogo no longer maintains an internal distinction between integers and
floating point numbers. So for example:

Old:

    observer> print 3
    3
    observer> print 3.0
    3.0
    observer> print 1 + 2
    3
    observer> print 1.5 + 1.5
    3.0
    observer> print 3 = 3.0
    true

(The last line shows that although the distinction between integer 3 and
floating point 3.0 was maintained, the two numbers were still considered equal.)

New:

    observer> print 3
    3
    observer> print 3.0
    3
    observer> print 1 + 2
    3
    observer> print 1.5 + 1.5
    3
    observer> print 3 = 3.0
    true

We expect that only rare models will be negatively impacted by this change.

A benefit of this change is that NetLogo now supports a much larger range of
integers. The old range was -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (around +/- 2
billion); the new range is +/-9,007,199,254,740,992 (around +/- 9 quadrillion).

### Agentset building

NetLogo 3.1 (and some earlier versions) included primitives called
`turtles-from` and `patches-from` that were occasionally useful for building
agentsets. In NetLogo 4.0, these primitives have been replaced with new
primitives called [[turtle-set]] and [[patch-set]] that are much more flexible
and powerful. ([[link-set]] exists as well.) See the entries for these
primitives in the NetLogo Dictionary. Models that use the old `turtles-from` and
`patches-from` will need to be altered by hand to use the new primitives.

### RGB Colors

In NetLogo 3.1 RGB and HSB colors could be approximated as NetLogo colors using
the `rgb` and `hsb` primitives. These have been renamed to [[approximate-rgb]]
and [[approximate-hsb]] and now expect inputs in the range 0-255, not 0-1.

The full RGB spectrum is now available in NetLogo so it may no longer be
necessary to use these primitives at all. You can set any color variable to a
three-item RGB list, with values in the 0-255 range, and get that exact color.
See the [Color](programming.html#colors) section of the Programming Guide for
details.

### Tie

In previous versions `__tie` was provided as an experimental feature. As of
NetLogo 4.0 links have a [[tie-mode]] variable which can be set to `"none"`,
`"free"`, or `"fixed"`. In 4.0 [[tie]] is now a link-only primitive. This means
that to tie turtle 1 to turtle 0 you write:

    ask turtle 0 [ create-link-to turtle 1 [ tie ] ]

See the [Tie](programming.html#tie) section of the programming guide for
details.

## Changes for NetLogo 3.1

### Agentsets

If your model is behaving strangely or incorrectly, it may be because since
NetLogo 3.1, agentsets are now always in random order. In prior versions of
NetLogo, agentsets were always in a fixed order. If your code depended on that
fixed order, then it won't work anymore. How to fix your model to work with
randomized agentsets depends on the details of what your code is doing. In some
situations, it is helpful to use the [[sort]] or [[sort-by]] primitives to
convert an agentset (random order) into a list of agents (fixed order). See
"Lists of agents" in the [Lists](programming.html#lists) section of the
Programming Guide.

### Wrapping

If you are seeing pieces of turtle shapes wrapping around the view edges, it's
because NetLogo 3.0 allowed you to turn off such wrapping in the view without
affecting the behavior of the model. Since NetLogo 3.1, if you don't want the
view to wrap you must make it so the world doesn't wrap, using the new topology
feature. Making this change may require other changes to your model, though. See
the [Topology](programming.html#topology) section of the Programming Guide for a
thorough discussion of how to convert your model to take advantage of this new
feature.

### Random turtle coordinates

Many models made in NetLogo 3.0 or earlier use
`setxy random world-width random world-height` to scatter turtles randomly,
using either `random` or `random-float`. It only works if world wrapping is on.

(Why? Because when wrapping is on, you can set coordinates of turtles to numbers
beyond the edge of the world and NetLogo will wrap the turtle to the other side.
But in worlds that don't wrap setting the x or y coordinates of a turtle to a
point outside the bounds of the world causes a runtime error. The world wrap
settings were added in NetLogo 3.1. See the
[Topology](programming.html#topology) section of the Programming Guide for more
information.)

To fix your model so that it works regardless of the wrapping settings, use one
of these two commands instead:

    setxy random-xcor random-ycor
    setxy random-pxcor random-pycor

The two commands are a bit different. The first command puts the turtle on a
random point in the world. The second command puts the turtle on the center of a
random patch. An even more concise way to put a turtle on the center of a random
patch is:

    move-to one-of patches
