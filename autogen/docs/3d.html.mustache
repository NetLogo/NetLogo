					<br />
					-- Edwin A. Abbott, <i>Flatland: A romance in many dimensions</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					NetLogo 3D's world has width, height and depth. Patches are cubes. In addition to
					<code><a href="dictionary.html#pcor">pxcor</a></code> and <code><a href="dictionary.html#pcor">pycor</a></code
					>, patches have <code><a href="#pzcor">pzcor</a></code
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Turtles have three Cartesian coordinates, instead of two, to describe position. In addition to
					<code><a href="dictionary.html#xcor">xcor</a></code> and <code><a href="dictionary.html#ycor">ycor</a></code
					>, turtles have <code><a href="#zcor">zcor</a></code
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					A turtle's orientation is defined by three turtle variables,
					<code><a href="dictionary.html#heading">heading</a></code
					>, <code><a href="#pitch">pitch</a></code> and <code><a href="#roll">roll</a></code
					>. You can imagine the turtle as having two vectors to define its orientation in 3D space. One vector comes
					straight out of the nose of the turtle, this is the direction the turtle will travel when it moves forward.
					The second vector is perpendicular to the forward vector and comes out of the right side of the turtle (as if
					the turtle were to stick its right arm straight out from its body). Heading is the angle between the forward
					vector of the turtle projected onto the xy-plane and the vector [0 1 0]. Pitch is the angle between the
					forward vector of the turtle and the xy-plane and finally roll is the angle between the right vector of the
					turtle and the xy-plane. When turtle turns right or left in 3D space it rotates around the down vector, that
					is the vector that is perpendicular to both the forward and right vectors. Depending on the orientation of the
					turtle more than one of the internal turtle variables may change as the result of a turn.
				</p>
				<h4>The observer and the 3D view</h4>
				<p>
					The point of view that you see the world from is considered the location and orientation of the observer. This
					is similar to the 3D view in NetLogo 2D. However, there are a few more ways to control the observer. You can
					set the point that the observer is facing by using
					<code>face</code> and <code>facexyz</code> which work the same way as the turtle commands, the observer turns
					so the center of the view is on the given point or the location of the given agent at the time it is called.
					You can change the location of the observer using <code>setxyz</code>. The observer will move to view the
					world as if standing on the given location, the point the observer faces will stay the same. For example
					create a new model and observer will be located at (0, 0, 49.5), that is, on the z-axis 49.5 patch units away
					from the origin and the observer is facing the origin, (0, 0, 0). If you <code>setxyz 0 49.5 0</code> the
					observer will move so it is on the positive y-axis but it will keep the origin at the center of the view. You
					can also move the observer using the rotation primitives that will allow you to move the observer around the
					world as if on the surface of a sphere where the center is the location the observer is facing. You may notice
					from the above examples that the observer is not constrained to be within the bounds of the world.
				</p>
				<h4>
					<a id="custom-shapes">Custom Shapes</a>
				</h4>
				<p>
					NetLogo automatically interprets 2D shapes so they are extruded, like a cookie cutter shape in the 3D view.
					You can also use the primitive
					<a href="#load-shapes-3d"><code>load-shapes-3d</code></a> to load shapes described in an external file in a
					custom format described here. Currently we do not import shapes in any standard formats.
				</p>
				<p>
					For each shape in a custom 3D shape file, a 2D shape of the same name must exist as well. You can create the
					2D shape in the Turtle Shapes Editor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The input file may contain any number of shapes with any number of rectangular or triangular surfaces. The
					format of the input file should be as follows:
				</p>
				<pre>
number of shapes in file
name of first shape
type of surface ( quads or tris )
surface1
surface2
.
.
.
stop
type of surface
surfaceA
.
.
.
stop
end-shape
</pre
				>
				<p>
					Each surface is defined by a unit normal vector and the vertices listed in clockwise order, tris should have
					three vertices and quads should have four.
				</p>
				<pre>
normal: xn yn zn
x1 y1 z1
x2 y2 z2
x3 y3 z3
x4 y4 z4
</pre
				>
				<p>
					A file declaring just a two dimensional, patch-sized, square in the xy-plane centered at the origin would look
					like this:
				</p>
				<pre>
1
square
quads
normal: 0 0 1
0.15 0.15 0
-0.15 0.15 0
-0.15 -0.15 0

				<h2>
					<a>Tutorial</a>
				</h2>
				<h4>Step 1: Depth</h4>
				<p>
					One of the first things you will notice when you open NetLogo 3D is that the world is a cube instead of a
					square.
				</p>
				<p class="screenshot">
					<img alt="screen shot" src="images/3d/cube.png" />
				</p>
				<p>
					You can open up the Model Settings, by clicking on the &quot;Settings...&quot; button at the top of the 3D
					View. You'll notice in addition to <code>max-pxcor</code>, <code>min-pxcor</code>, <code>max-pycor</code>, and
					<code>min-pycor</code>, there is also <a href="#min-max-pzcor"><code>max-pzcor</code></a> and
					<a href="#min-max-pzcor"><code>min-pzcor</code></a
					>.
				</p>
				<p class="screenshot">
					<img alt="screen shot" src="images/3d/properties.png" />
				</p>
				<p>
					The z-axis is perpendicular to both the x-axis and the y-axis, when you <code>reset-perspective</code> it is
					the axis that comes straight out of the screen. In the default position <code>max-pzcor</code> is the face of
					the cube nearest to you and <code>min-pzcor</code> is the face farthest from you. As always
					<code>min-pxcor</code> is on the left, <code>max-pxcor</code> on the right, <code>min-pycor</code> on the
					bottom, and <code>max-pycor</code> on the top.
				</p>
				<p>
					You'll also notice on the left side of the Model Settings that there are options for wrapping in all three
					directions, however, they are all checked and grayed out. Topologies are not yet supported in NetLogo 3D, so
					the world always wraps in all dimensions.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>Move to the Command Center and type <code>print count patches</code>.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question">Is the number smaller or larger than you expected?</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					In a 3D world the number of patches grows very quickly since
					<code>count patches = world-width * world-height * world-depth</code>. It's important to keep this in mind
					when you are building your model. Lots of patches can slow your model down or even cause NetLogo to run out of
					memory.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>Type <code>ask patch 1 2 3 [ set pcolor red ]</code> into the Command Center.</li>
						<li>Use the mouse in the 3D view to rotate the world.</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Notice the shape of the patch and its position in relation to the edges of the world. You'll also notice that
					you now need three coordinates to address patches in a 3D world.
				</p>
				<h4>Step 2: Turtle Movement</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Open the Models Library in the File menu. (If you are on a Mac and you don't have a File menu, click on
							the main NetLogo window first and it should reappear.)
						</li>
						<li>Open Turtle and Observer Motion Example 3D in 3D/Code Examples</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Take a moment to look for the controls and monitors. In the bottom left you'll notice a group of monitors that
					describe the location and orientation of the turtle, though until you press the setup button they'll all say
					&quot;N/A&quot;.
				</p>
				<div class="blockquote">
					<ul>
						<li>Press the &quot;setup&quot; button</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					Heading, pitch, and roll are turtle variables that represent the orientation of the turtle. Heading is
					absolute in relation to the x/y plane; it is the rotation of the turtle around the z-axis.
				</p>
				<p class="screenshot">
					<img alt="screen shot" src="images/3d/heading.png" />
				</p>
				<p>Pitch is the angle between the nose of the turtle and the xy-plane. It is relative to heading.</p>
				<p class="screenshot">
					<img alt="screen shot" src="images/3d/pitch.png" />
				</p>
				<p>Roll is the rotation around the turtle's forward vector. It is relative to heading and pitch.</p>
				<p class="screenshot">
					<img alt="screen shot" src="images/3d/roll.png" />
				</p>
				<p>
					When turtles are created with <code>create-turtles</code> or <code>create-ordered-turtles</code>, their
					initial headings vary but their initial pitch and roll are always zero.
				</p>
				<p>Take a look at the &quot;Turtle Movement&quot; buttons.</p>
				<div class="blockquote">
					<ul>
						<li>Press the &quot;left 1&quot; button.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question">
						How does the turtle move? Is is the same or different from 2D NetLogo? Which of the turtle variables change?
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Press the &quot;pitch-down 1&quot; button.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question">How does the turtle move? Which of the turtle variables change?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Press the &quot;left 1&quot; button again.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question">
						How does the turtle move? Is it different than the last time you pressed the &quot;left 1&quot; button?
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Take a little time to play with the Turtle Movement buttons, watching both how the turtle moves and which
							of the turtle variables change.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					You probably noticed that often more than one of the turtle variables may change for a single turn. For this
					reason we suggest that you use the turtle commands rather than setting the orientation variables directly.
				</p>
				<h4>Step 3: Observer Movement</h4>
				<p>
					At the bottom of the interface you will see Orbit, Zoom, and Move buttons. If you have ever used the 3D view
					in NetLogo 2D or if you have been using the mouse controls in the 3D view through this tutorial you have been
					moving the observer. Changing the point of view in the 3D view is actually moving and changing the orientation
					of the observer. The observer has x, y and z coordinates, just like a turtle or patch, while turtles and
					patches are constrained to be inside the world the observer can be anywhere. Like a turtle the observer has a
					heading, pitch and roll, these variables control where the observer is looking, that is, what you see in the
					view.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Move to the 3D view, and make sure &quot;Orbit&quot; is selected in the bottom left corner of the view.
						</li>
						<li>
							Click and hold the mouse button in the middle of the view, move the mouse left, right, up, and down.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question">How does the position and orientation of the observer change?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Press the reset-perspective button in the lower right corner of the view and select &quot;Zoom&quot; in
							the lower left corner.
						</li>
						<li>Click and hold the mouse button in the middle of the view and move the mouse up and down.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question">Which of the observer variables change? Which stay the same?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Try rotating the world a bit and then zoom again.</li>
						<li>Press the &quot;Move&quot; button in the lower left corner of the view.</li>
						<li>
							Click and hold the mouse button in the middle of the view and move the mouse up, down, left and right.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question">How does the view change? How do the observer variables change?</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					After you are done exploring the world using the mouse controls you can take a look at the observer control
					buttons in the lower left portion of the interface.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may already be familiar with the first three buttons in the observer group from your experience with
					NetLogo 2D. Watch, follow, and ride, are special modes that automatically update the position and orientation
					of the observer. When in follow or ride mode, the observer position and orientation are the same as the
					turtle's. Note that follow and ride are functionally exactly the same, the difference is only visual in the 3D
					view. When in watch mode the observer does not move but updates to face the target agent.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>Press the &quot;setup&quot; button again so you are back to the default orientation.</li>
						<li>Press the &quot;orbit-right&quot; button.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question">
						How did the view change? Was it what you expected? How is it similar or different from using the mouse
						controls?
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Take a little time to experiment with orbit, roll and zoom buttons; notice similarities and differences to
							the mouse controls.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					The direction of the orbit commands refer to the direction that the observer moves. That is, imagine that the
					observer is on the surface of a sphere, the center of the sphere is the point that the observer is facing
					represented by the blue cross, by default (0,0,0). The observer will always face the center of the sphere and
					the radius of the sphere will remain constant. The directions, up, down, left, and right, refer to moving
					along the lines of latitude and the lines of longitude of the sphere. When you zoom the radius of the sphere
					changes but the center and the observer's orientation in relation to the center of the sphere will remain the
					same.
				</p>
				<div class="blockquote">
					<ul>
						<li>Press one of the &quot;setxyz&quot; buttons.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question">How does the view change? How do the observer variables change?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Press the &quot;facexyz&quot; button.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question">How does the view change? How do the observer variables change?</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					When you <code>setxyz</code> the center of the sphere remains the same (so the observer automatically keeps
					that point in the center of the view.) However, the radius of the sphere may change as well as the observer's
					orientation in relation to the center. When you <code>facexyz</code> or <code>face</code>, the center of the
					sphere changes but the observer does not move. The radius of the sphere may change, as well as the orientation
					of the observer.

						This is a built-in turtle variable. Pitch is the angle between the &quot;nose&quot; of the turtle and the

						Depending on the position more than one relative angle (heading, pitch and roll) may change at once.
					</p>
					<p>Example:</p>
					<pre>
