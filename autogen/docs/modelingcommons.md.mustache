## Introduction

![Modeling Commons](images/modelingcommons/modelingcommons.png)

The Modeling Commons (http://modelingcommons.org/) is a Web-based collaboration
system for NetLogo modelers. Users of the Modeling Commons can share, download,
modify, create variations of, comment on, and run NetLogo models -- both those
that are a part of the NetLogo models library, and also those that have been
uploaded by other NetLogo users.

By uploading your NetLogo models to the Modeling Commons, you make it easy for
others to see, review, and comment on your work. You can optionally keep the
model private, either to yourself or to a group of your choice, if you aren't
comfortable with letting everyone see the model. You can always change the
permissions associated with a model, if you change your mind later on.

NetLogo now makes it possible to save models to the Modeling Commons, just as
you can save them to `.nlogo` files on your own computer. You can access this
functionality by selecting "Upload to Modeling Commons" from the "File" menu.

Use of the Modeling Commons is free of charge. You may use it for your own
personal work, for your research group or company, or for a class in which you
are a student or teacher. The Modeling Commons is sponsored by the CCL, the same
group that develops and distributes NetLogo.

## Modeling Commons Accounts

![[Log in to Modeling Commons|login.png]]

In order to upload models to the Modeling Commons, you must first be a
registered user. Unregistered users can view and download models, but cannot
upload, edit, or comment on them.

The first time that you invoke "Save to Modeling Commons" in NetLogo, you will
be prompted to enter your e-mail address and password. If you already have an
account, then you can enter this information and click on the "Login" button.

If you don't yet have an account with the Modeling Commons, then you will need
to create one. Click on the "Create Account" button, and enter the requested
information. Once you have done so, click on the "Create Account" button. If
there are no errors, then you will be prompted to upload a NetLogo model.
Alternatively, you may go to
[the Modeling Commons itself](http://modelingcommons.org/) and register with
your Web browser.

## Uploading Models

There are three ways to upload a model to the Modeling Commons:
Uploading, updating, and creating a child ("forking"). The following sections
describe these in detail.

### Upload A New Model

A new model will be created in the Modeling Commons, with its own
page, description, and forum. You should use this function the first
time that you save a model to the Modeling Commons.

You must give your model a name. Model names are not required to be
unique; you could have 2 or more models with the same name, though we
recommend that you not do this.

By default, anyone can view, fork, and update your model. You can
restrict the ability to view and fork your model by changing the
visibility permission. You can restrict the ability to update your
model by changing the changeability permission. In order to set
permissions for multiple people, assign your model to a group, and
then restrict visibility or changeability to members of that group.
Groups can be created from the
[Modeling Commons](http://modelingcommons.org/account/groups#group_tabs_new_group).
Once you have uploaded your model, you can edit the permissions from the model's
Modeling Commons page.

You can optionally upload a preview image to your model. The preview image will
be displayed alongside your model whenever it is shown on the Modeling Commons.
While uploading a preview image is optional, we highly recommend that you do so,
in one of the following three ways:

- The "Use current image" option tells NetLogo to use the current view as your
  preview. We recommend that you first run the model, such that it shows off the
  key visual features.
- The "Auto-generate image" feature auto-generates a preview image by running
  `random-seed 0 setup repeat 75 [ go ]`. This option will only be enabled if
  you have defined `setup` and `go` procedures for NetLogo to run.
- The "Image from file" feature allows you to upload any PNG image. Preview
  images work best when they are square.

### Upload A Child Of An Existing Model ("forking")

Saving a model in this way, sometimes known as "forking," does not change or
overwrite the original model. Rather, it creates a new model on the Modeling
Commons, much as a plain "save" would do, simultaneously creating a parent-child
relationship between the old model and the new one. This relationship can be
seen on the "family" tab for a given model. You may fork any model for which you
have "view" permissions, including one that you cannot change. You may wish, for
example, to create a variation on a model in the NetLogo models library.

To fork a model, you must give your new child a name, as well as select an
existing model to fork. To indicate the existing model, start typing the name of
the model that you would like to fork. Select its name from among the search
results.

Finally, you must enter a description about what you are changing in your child
model, and how it relates to its parent.

## Updating An Existing Model

Use this option if you have improved a model that already exists in the
Modeling Commons. Existing attachments, discussions, and social tags will be
preserved, but the model that users can display, run, and download will be
updated. You may only update a model for which you have "write" permissions.

All versions of a model are saved in the Modeling Commons, so you should feel
free to experiment with new ideas. If something goes wrong, you can always refer
to an old version from the "history" tab on a model's page.

To indicate which model should be updated, start typing the name of the model.
Select the name that pops up with the search results. Finally, enter a
description about what you are changing in your new version.
