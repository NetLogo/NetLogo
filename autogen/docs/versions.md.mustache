## Version 6.4.0 (November 2023)

A major change in this release the introduction of new features in [BehaviorSpace](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/behaviorspace.html)
### BehaviorSpace New Features
- A new syntax that allows parameter combinations to be run separately,
rather than being expanded combinatorically.
- Measurements can be conditionally recorded when a boolean reporter is true.
- Commands can be run before the experiment begins.
- Commands can be run after the experiment ends.
- The mean and standard deviation of data from repetitions can be output to a file.
- List data can be output to a file with one list element per cell.
- Experiments can now be paused and resumed.
- Experiments can now be exported to an XML file that can be used when running headlessly.
- Experiments in an XML file can now be imported into a model.
- There is a reduction in memory usage for experiments containing plots when *Update plots and monitors* is unchecked in the *Run options dialog*.

### Language Changes

The `let` and `set` primitives now support taking a list of variable names as the first argument and will assign values to those variables from a list of values given as the second argument.  This is useful in many situations, but especially when you want to have a reporter procedure calculate and report multiple values to be used elsewhere.

A new reporter primitive has been added, `who-are-not`.  It takes an agentset as a lefthand side argument and an agent or another agentset as a righthand side argument and reports all agents in the former who are not in the latter.  For example:  `let strangers turtles who-are-not link-neighbors`.

### Bug Fixes and Changes

- The save dialog will no longer appear when clicking the close button on an already-saved includes file code tab.
- When an includes code file is edited, compiled, and closed without saving, the model will correctly re-compile without the unsaved change.
- When extensions are updated through the extensions manager, existing files and libraries for them will be removed so conflicts between versions cannot occur.
- An error will no longer occur when opening a NetLogo model stored in the user's home directory due to the extension locating code trying to search restricted folders.
- Plotting now uses its own RNG that is cloned from the main RNG and updated when the main RNG changes.  This means if plotting is enabled, it will be reproducible from the main RNG, but if plotting is disabled the behavior of the model will not change when using the same main RNG seed.
- A failed compile of a string as a command with `run` could cause the same string to fail to run as a reporter using `runresult` later.
- Patch colors can now be set to RGBA values with an alpha channel, the alpha channel is just ignored as there is nothing "behind" patches.  Previously this would cause an error to occur.
- Users can add symbolic links to their models library folders to point to other directories to have those models available for loading in the app.  This had worked in a prior version of NetLogo, but was accidentally disabled with other bugfixes.
- The `link-neighbor?` boolean reporter has had some small optimizations done to improve performance.
- Agent labels now support linebreaks.
- Errors that happen when NetLogo is starting but before the full interface appears should now be caught and displayed in a simple dialog.  Previously to see such errors NetLogo would have to be started from a command line console.
- The default maximum memory usage for NetLogo is now set to 50% of system memory instead of a static limit of 1 gigabyte.  For systems with greater than 2 gigabytes of memory this should give improved performance and reduce the chance of getting out of memory errors during model runs.
- When the extension manager is disabled via the Java environment property, no data will be fetched over the network.  Previously the current extension listing would be fetched even though using the list in the manager was disabled.
- The `<breed>-at` primitive now works properly in 3D.  Previously it would function as the 2D version, only getting agents with z-coordinate of 0.

#### BehaviorSpace Bug fixes and changes
- 3D BehaviorSpace runs are now allowed.
- BehaviorSpace no longer exits when there is a plot compilation error.
- Error messages for BehaviorSpace variable errors have been improved.
- BehaviorSpace output files no longer contain trailing spaces.
- Headless console mode now has a `--help` flag.
- The *Experiment dialog* makes use of tooltips and has a cleaner look.
- Changes will not be saved if the close/X button of the *Experiment dialog* is hit.
- The number of threads in the *Run options dialog* is now saved.
- Experiments will not run if the close/X button of the *Run options dialog* is hit.

### Extension Updates

- The Bitmap extension now supports reading images from base64-encoded strings and writing images out to base64-encoded strings.
- The GIS extension has a couple of bug fixes: 1) its string-based search of features could include too many items, and 2) the code for creating turtles inside a polygon was executed for existing turtles outside that polygon.

### Documentation Updates

- The logical operator precedence for `and` and `or` is clarified in the docs as not exactly matching how other programming languages function.
- Clarify that `mouse-inside?` only works when the mouse is in the world, not only in the view, which can happen with unwrapped worlds and use of the `follow` primitive.
- Removed the `->` variable, a leftover from the switch from the old anonymous task syntax.
- Clarify that an extension must be installed for the extensions keyword to take effect.

### Models Library Changes

#### New Sample Models:
- Food Reward Learning
- Current in a Semiconductor
- Radical Polymerization with Chains
- Food Reward Learning
- Baldwin Effect

#### Sample Model Changes
- Fixed a minor issue in the Monte Carlo Lennard-Jones model.
- Renamed Prisoner's Dilemma models from "PD" to "Prisoner's Dilemma" and clarified that "confess" means "defect" in the info tab.
- Polymer dynamics model info tab was edited to indicate that this is not strictly speaking a cellular automata.
- Wolf Sheep Predation was updated to include BehaviorSpace experiments that use the new BehaviorSpace features.
- Anisogomy model was updated and improved.

## Version 6.3.0 (September 2022)

### Bug Fixes and Changes

- The major change in this release is the upgrade of the bundled Java from version 8 to 17. Java 17 is the current long-term-support release of the Java runtime.
- The models library will correctly display when NetLogo is set to a language other than English.
- The log4j library has been removed from NetLogo. Logging is now configured from the NetLogo preferences dialog.  The output is in JSON text file format. See the Logging docs for more information.
- BehaviorSpace experiments can now also be run from a terminal or command console using the `NetLogo_Console` app with NetLogo's bundled Java by using the `--headless` flag.  See the BehaviorSpace documentation for more information and examples.  This avoids the need to install and configure a separate Java runtime to use the `netlogo-headless.sh` script, which remains bundled for those who require it.
- BehaviorSpace output files are now chosen directly during run setup instead of separate prompts at the run start.  This simplifies the setup process and resolves a bug where the runs would not occur on macOS.
- The System Dynamics Modeler UI has some small improvements.
- Fixed a bug where slider widgets would allow initial values outside of their range when changing the limits.
- Better handle asymptotic values for tan with a proper error message.
- NetLogo will now correctly handle running `map` or `foreach` when no lists are given.
- When an anonymous task that uses `let` variables is displayed as a string it will now include those variable names.
- Reporters used in concise task syntax no longer give the wrong result when used with fewer arguments than their default.
- The models library location will be correctly set when using GUI scripts.
- Behaviorsearch now sets a flag to alert extensions that they are being run without a UI so that extension code can adjust appropriately.

### Extension Updates

- GoGo: Improve newer GoGo board compatibility and improve the stability of the extension.
- LevelSpace: Eliminate crashes when the controlling API is used to run NetLogo without a UI.
- Profiler: The `profiler:data` results are now given in milliseconds instead of nanoseconds, matching the other primitives in the extension.
- Python: Improvements in how the extension searches for the Python binaries when they aren't specified via the configuration menu.
- Vid: Update backing libraries to try to improve stability and usability on macOS and Windows.

### Documentation Updates

- Update the system requirements to include Windows 11.

## Version 6.2.0 (December 2020)

### Features

A premier feature for this release is a pop-out code tab, that allows you to detach the code tab from the main application and into a separate window in order to view the interface and the model code side-by-side.

- The models library now shows code examples that come with extensions installed through the extensions manager.
- We now bundle the Liberica OpenJDK Java runtime instead of the Oracle Java runtime, which has a less restrictive license.
- The `mean` primitive will now work on lists that contain non-numbers as other number processing primitives do.
- The extensions manager can be disabled with a command-line switch to avoid network traffic or to lock down installed extensions.

### Bugfixes

- We've made changes to how we bundle NetLogo on macOS in order to satisfy Apple's package notarization process for detecting malware.  NetLogo now runs without any special workarounds, as long as your macOS settings allow running software from identified developers.
- When first opening a model and installing a new extension for it through the extensions manager prompt, the model widgets would not be usable until the model's code was recompiled.  Now the model will be ready to use right after the extension is installed.
- When using `in-cone` on wrapped worlds, occasionally turtles at the very edge of the wrapped cone would be missing from the results.
- When using `in-radius` on a patch to get nearby turtles, sometimes turtles at the edge of the radius would be missing from the results.
- The performance of a turtle lookup by breed and who-number, like `sheep 10`, could take an unreasonable amount of time.
- Models with a large amount of code (5000+ lines) would take a very long time to check and compile.

### Logging Improvements

- Logging can now be enabled and a configuration file chosen through the NetLogo preferences menu.  The logging standalone application is no longer necessary, so it has been removed.
- The command line switch to set the logging directory would previously be ignored.
- Users now get a chance to add a comment to the log when they get a compiler error.

### NetLogo 3D Bugfixes

- The `in-radius` and `in-cone` primitives could give incorrect results, omitting some agents in rare cases.
- When hatching turtles the z-coordinates would sometimes not be copied from the parent turtle.
- The font size value for the world view would be ignored.
- When using `with` with patches, the results could include only patches with a zero z-coordinate.
- NetLogo 3D should run more reliably on Linux systems.

### Extension Changes

- The Time extension is now bundled with NetLogo.  This extension lets you work with real-world dates and times in your model, and includes an event scheduler for triggering events at points in time.  It also includes an NLS library file you can add to your model to handle time series reading from CSV files.  See [the Time extension docs](https://github.com/NetLogo/Time-Extension) for more information.
- The View2.5D extension has been significantly upgraded. Turtle stem color can be set by a reporter. Links are now visible in the 2.5D window. They can be visualized either going from turtle to turtle (the default) or in the xy-plane.  The choice can be made using radio buttons or through new commands
- LevelSpace now always runs hidden models at full speed and should give better error messages when errors occur when loading a model.
- The Network (NW) extension will not add extra whitespace when using `nw:save-matrix`.
- The Python extension gives better error messages when the paths to the Python executables are incorrect.

### Documentation Changes

- Tutorial #1 referenced an older version of the Wolf Sheep Predation model.
- Added a couple more common problems to look out for in the BehaviorSpace guide.
- Clarify the version of NetLogo Web used to export models as HTML files.
- Clarify that the auto scale feature for plots does not scale the X axis when used with `histogram`.
- Clarify the location of the `NetLogo.cfg` files on each operating system.
- Update steps to take for common issues opening on macOS, added an alert about known issues to the download page.
- The docs for `ifelse` had some incorrect argument names.
- Add info about the Pioneer Award for the View 2.5D extension.

- Solid Diffusion
- Polymer Dynamics
- Lennard-Jones
- Dislocation Motion and Deformation
- Crystallization Models

Also in this folder are the MaterialSim models. They have been physically moved to the Curricular Models folder, but will be cross-referenced in `Chemistry & Physics/Materials Science`.

Note, the above BEAGLE models have now been physically moved into the `Curricular Models/BEAGLE Evolution/` folder. In the Models Library browser, they will appear cross-referenced in the usual places.

#### Code Examples Updates:
- `view2.5d` Extension - 2.5d Patch View Example: Fixed issue with perspective not being updated on `setup`.
- `gogo` Extension - GoGoMonitor: Minor INFO tab updates.

## Version 6.1.1 (September 2019)

### Bugfixes

- The `remove-duplicates` primitive will now operate properly on lists of agentsets, considering agentsets duplicates if they contain exactly the same agents.
- Many fixes to the `in-radius` primitive, which could report incorrect values when used with a radius that's a large percentage of an unwrapped world width or cause runtime errors when world sizes changed or when the radius wrapped around the world back to itself.
- Corrected issues with code tab compile errors causing unexpected behavior or runtime errors in the interface tab, especially when a model had breeded links.
- You can now use the same `let` variable name in different command blocks inside a procedure.
- The `netlogo-headless.sh` scripts for macOS and Linux had issues with running the 3D command switch and properly wrapping the Java executable  in quotes in case it contains spaces.

### Features

- Runtime speed optimizations when using the `count` primitive on turtle or link agentsets with a comparison operator like `>` or `=`.

### Extension Changes

- The Python extension on Windows will no longer give permissions errors when trying to create it's config file, moved the file to a per-user directory.
- The Python extension will no longer produce a confusing deprecation warning when used with Python 3.7.
- Moved the storage location for the R extension config files to a per-user directory and updated documentation around getting it working.  This issue mostly affected Windows users.
- The Mathematica-Link add-on now works correctly with NetLogo 6.1.0 and 6.1.1.

### Documentation Changes

- Clarified the file location search order for extensions with the new extension manager.
- Standardized the language used in the conditional primitives (`if`, `ifelse`, `ifelse-value`) and the boolean operators (`and`, `not`, `or`, `xor`).
- Use correct arrow syntax in the `ifelse-value` code example.
- Added notes to `ifelse` and `ifelse-value` that the multi-conditional behavior was newly added in version 6.1.

## Version 6.1.0 (May 2019)

### Feature Changes

The premier feature for this release is an **Extension Manager** for installing and updating extensions, which is available under the Tools menu.  Using extensions with NetLogo could be a painful process: manually finding them, downloading them, and getting them correctly installed in the NetLogo application.  The extensions manager addresses these issues by automating the installation of many 3rd-party extensions, and the updating of the bundled extensions between NetLogo releases.  All done easily from within the application.  In fact, if you open a model that requires an extension you don’t have installed that it knows about, the Extension Manager will ask if you’d like to download and install it right on the spot, without any extra effort

We welcome external contributions to the extensions library!  If you have developed a NetLogo extension and want to make it available to NetLogo users in the Extension Manager, see these instructions:  https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo-Libraries#submitting-pull-requests

Other new features include:

- The primitives `ifelse` and `ifelse-value` now take a varying number of clauses, making selecting a single case from a variety of options much simpler.
- Added a new primitive, `up-to-n-of`, which gives as many items from a list as possible up to some limit, without causing an error if it cannot get all of them.  Previously, to safely use `n-of` when you were unsure of the number of agents in an agentset would require some verbose code like `ask n-of (ifelse-value (count turtles-here < 10) [count turtles-here] [10]) turtles-here [ fd 10 ]`, but now you can simple write `ask up-to-n-of turtles-here [ fd 10 ]` to get the same effect.
- Added new hotkeys: Command-U for "Show Usage" of a term, Command-E for "Jump to Declaration" of a procedure, and Command-Option-S for "Save All" when using included NetLogo code files.  Or Ctrl-U, Ctrl-E, Ctrl-Alt-S for Windows and Linux users.
- Multiline input widgets are now directly editable on the interface tab.
- Runtime optimizations for the `in-radius` and `in-cone` primitives.

### Bugfixes

- When a model that has a compile-time error is saved, its sliders will not reset their values to 0 when it is reloaded.
- The procedures search dropdown on the Code tab gives better results with inexact search terms.
- Plot pen names with quotes in them are properly stored and loaded.
- Plot pen names are now case-insensitive, just like other items in NetLogo.
- When a plot is deleted and the action is undone, the plot continues to work afterward.
- 2D NetLogo models saved in NetLogo 3D can be opened back into 3D, or de-converted by re-opening in NetLogo 2D.
- Widgets can no longer be re-sized to be completely outside the interface tab.
- Code comments can be used as normal within an `__includes` keyword file list.
- The error message for getting the `mean` of an empty list should now make more sense.
- Double-clicking an empty experiment list in BehaviorSpace will not cause an error.
- BehaviorSpace experiments are better about warning when there are astronomical numbers of run combinations.
- Anonymous procedures can be given in the conditional reporter blocks of `ifelse-value`.
- Slight changes to how color values are calculated, for smoother interoperability with NetLogo Web.

### Extension Changes

- The Python extension, `py`, is now bundled with NetLogo.  If you have Python installed on your computer, you can use it from inside a NetLogo model.
- The Control Flow extension, `cf`, has been removed from NetLogo in favor of the new variadic `ifelse` and `ifelse-value` behavior.  The `cf` extension is still available from the extensions library if needed for any existing models.
- The CSV extension, `csv`, had some minor documentation updates.
- The GoGo board extension, `gogo`, should work more reliably on Windows 10.
- The Network extension, `nw`, now loads data in a predictable order when imported, and it correctly handles preferential attachment.
- The Table extension, `table`, had some minor documentation updates.
- The View 2.5D extension, `view2.5d`, now does not throw an error when trying to use a turtle-based view.

### Documentation Changes

- Added documentation around using primitives like `mean` and `variance` along with agentsets producing slightly different results due to floating point arithmetic.
- Add an extension authoring introduction page with links to the technical documentation.
- Clarify what `clear-ticks` is meant to do.
- Clarify that `clear-globals` doesn't affect interface globals.
- Fixed various formatting errors and typos.

With the introduction of the new variadic `ifelse` and `ifelse-value` primitives, the Models Library has been updated to reflect this new functionality. These updates are divided into three major sections:

- Add parens to `ifelse-value` expressions that are arguments of infix operator.
- Remove unnecessary parentheses from `ifelse-value` invocations for models that use `ifelse-value` with a simple infix conditional: `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, and `=`. This results in changes to the following models.
- Remove now unnecessary parens from calls to `ifelse-value` with more complex conditionals.

And here are the models affected by these changes:

- Code Examples:
    - Beatbox
    - HSB and RGB Example
    - NW General Examples

- Fixed a bug with the nw extension preferential attachment generation and initialization.
- Fixed a numerical error with the `range` primitive.
- Fixed a bug with link lookup when using more than two link breeds.
- Comment and uncomment code hotkeys should work with NetLogo include source files.
- Added a better error message when a web browser couldn't be launched for any reason.

### Documentation Changes

  * MTG 1 Equal Opportunities HubNet
  * MTG 2 Random Assignment HubNet
  * MTG 3 Feedback Loop HubNet

#### Revised Sample Models

- GenEvo - GenEvo 2: Fixed `save screenshot` bug on Windows machines
- GenEvo - GenEvo 3: Fixed `save screenshot` bug on Windows machines

#### Revised Alternative Visualizations

- Flocking (Alternative Visualizations): Changed default `vision` to `5.0` patches

## Version 6.0.3 (March 2018)

### Feature Changes

- Improve the look & feel of Agent Monitor windows.
- The procedures menu in the code tab now has a search field and actively filters procedure names as the user types. This should improve navigation speed for large models with lots of procedures. There is also now a hotkey to access this menu: Ctrl-G on Windows and Linux, and Cmd-G on MacOS.
- Increase the speed of the `diffusion` primitive and make the diffusion operation symmetric.
- NetLogo enforces that plot names are unique and that pen names are per-plot unique without taking capitalization into account. This avoids certain cases where `set-current-plot` and `set-current-plot-pen` primitives would set the plot or pen to something different than the user intended because names differed in capitalization only.
- Models with existing plots and pens which have the same name without taking capitalization into account will be automatically converted on first open in 6.0.3.
- We are planning on adding the ability to have multiple conditional branches to `ifelse` and `ifelse-value`. However, as this is a fairly substantial change to the core language, we have implemented it in the cf extension for testing. See [the `cf` documentation](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/cf.html) for information about the new syntax.

### Documentation Changes

- Add a table to the Output section of the Programming Guide specifying how the various output primitives differ in whether they print the calling agent, whether they print a newline, and whether they can be read back into NetLogo.

### Bugfixes

- Anonymous procedures appearing inside `ask` blocks inside `repeat` blocks now close over unique copies of let-variables introduced in the `repeat` block.
- Fix a longstanding HubNet bug in which HubNet would sometimes crash as a large number of users joined.
- Fix HubNet discovery when the HubNet server is run on a Mac.
- When switching from the code tab to the interface tab, the cursor switches to the command center. This prevents typed commands or copy/paste keyboard shortcuts from affecting the code tab.
- Turtles draw trails when moving backwards (regression in NetLogo 6.0.1).
- Smooth Code Tab scrolling.
- BehaviorSpace now only applies standard CSV string escaping (doubling of double quotes) to string outputs in result files. It used to apply NetLogo style string escaping (backslashes in front of special characters) and then apply CSV escaping on top of that. The new behavior is consistent with the RFC 4180 specification and the current behavior of the `csv` extension.
- The Behaviorspace dialog appears centered in the NetLogo window.
- Due to changes introduced in Java, certain dialogs in NetLogo 6.0.1 would appear under the dialog that created them instead of on top. These dialogs now appear on top of the dialog that created them.
- Non-code changes to the System Dynamics modeler are pulled in on every recompile (prior to this, changes like newly-disconnected flows were sometimes not taken into account on recompiles).
- The system dynamics code tab adjusts itself to match the size of the system dynamics window.
- NetLogo 3D loads and saves system dynamics.
- Fixes an error raised in 3D when the world was cleared following setting a patch-color to an RGB list.
- Miscellaneous small changes to the format of exported worlds. NetLogo 6.0.3 should be able to import worlds exported by older versions of NetLogo and older versions of NetLogo should be able to import worlds exported by NetLogo 6.0.3.
- The "others" execute bit is set for the netlogo-headless.sh script in the Linux installer package.

### Extension Changes

- [`nw:generate-preferential-attachment`](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/nw.html#nw:generate-preferential-attachment) accepts a `min-degree` parameter, specifying the number of links each new turtle preferentially creates to existing turtles.
- The `arduino` extension (and the related sketch and model in the library) have been updated to allow the arduino to send strings back to NetLogo. Two new debug primitives have also been added to help troubleshoot interaction between NetLogo and the arduino.
- The verbose `cf` extension conditional syntax as been replaced with straight-forward generalizations of the `ifelse` and `ifelse-value` primitives. The syntax is much simpler and these primitives run much faster than the old constructs.
- The `ls` extension has much less overhead for calling out to single models, making constructs like `ask turtles [ ls:ask my-model [ run-something ] ]` much faster.
- The `ls` extension now seeds the child model RNG based on the parent model RNG at model creation. Furthermore, and `ls:random-seed` primitive has been introduced, so an entire model system can be seeded simultaneously. This makes it possible to have reproducible runs when using LevelSpace.
- The `ls:let` primitive now handles scoping properly.
- `ls:assign` has been added to LevelSpace to make assigning globals of child models easier.

### Documentation Changes

- Clarify documentation around `__includes` by providing examples.
- Fix a broken link in the dictionary.
- Update the Windows unattended installation directions in the FAQ.

## Version 6.0.2 (August 2017)

### Feature Changes

- The autosuggest functionality introduced in NetLogo 6 will now display extension primitive names.
- A new `insert-item` primitive was added to the language. It works similarly to `replace-item`, but without removing the item at the specified index.
- A new `set-plot-background-color` primitive was added to the language. It can be used in plotting code to set the background color of the plot.
- Behaviorsearch's user interface has been updated. It now uses the JavaFX UI toolkit for a more modern look and feel.

### Bugfixes

- The 6.0.1 autoconverter would error when converting tasks with exactly one argument (from 5.3.1 and earlier models only). The conversion would be correct, but it was confusing. This has now been remedied and the autoconverter will correctly convert models from 5.3.1 and earlier without erroring on single-argument tasks.
- Fix a bug where extensions weren't located properly when in a path relative to the model.
- Help browser now opens in 64-bit Windows.
- Fix a speed regression for the `import-world` primitive introduced in 6.0.
- If an unexpected reporter block is passed to `with` when used with `other`, the error will now reflect that the block is unsuitable for `with` instead of `other`.
- When `sort-by` receives an unsuitable reporter block from the user it now shows a useful error instead of a cryptic stack trace.
- String representations of anonymous procedures now show the arguments of those anonymous procedures
- When working in an nls file, switching to a different tab will compile the nls file.
- Display error label on nls file when the code it contains causes an error.
- Some users were unable to open NetLogo 6 and 6.0.1 in Mac OS Sierra.
  We've changed our signing process in 6.0.2 to attempt to fix this problem.
  We are continuing to track this issue to determine whether our fix was effective.
  More information (including a partial workaround for the problem) is available [here](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Known-Issues#netlogo-wont-start-on-mac-os-sierra).

### Extension Changes

- Fixed a bug in `gis:patch-dataset` introduced in NetLogo 6.
- The table extension has new `table:group-agents` and `table:group-items` primitives which can be used to build a table of grouped agents and items by supplying an anonymous reporter.

### Documentation Changes

- Clarify when various parts of the anonymous procedure syntax are optional.
- Fix a few small documentation bugs around `foreach`.
- Clarify relationship between speed and update modality in the "View Updates" section of the programming guide.

### Model Changes

#### New Sample Models:

- Chaos in a Box
- Fairy Circles
- SmoothLife

#### New Curricular Models:

- Lattice Land Curriculum
    - Lattice Land - Triangles Explore
    - Lattice Land - Triangles Dissection

## Version 6.0.1 (March 2017)

### Feature Changes

- Brackets are required around anonymous procedure reporters only when there are two or more arguments. For instance `[ [x] -> x ]` can now be written `[ x -> x ]`. Note this change makes it possible to create models in NetLogo 6.0.1 that will not run in NetLogo 6.0. If you plan to use your model in NetLogo 6.0, be sure to include brackets around anonymous procedure arguments. For a short period after the release, models which use unbracketed lambda arguments may not work on netlogoweb.org.

### Bugfixes

- The NetLogo code editor navigates and indents models much more quickly and efficiently than in NetLogo 6.0.
- The NetLogo 5-to-6 autoconverter now ignores commented-out code.
- The behavior of layout-radial in NetLogo 6 did not match the 5.3.1 behavior. This has been corrected and layout-radial should be identical between NetLogo 6.0.1 and NetLogo 5.3.1
- NetLogo 6 raised a NullPointerException when numbers became too large for NetLogo to handle. This is now properly displayed to the user as a number out of bounds error.
- Improved performance of models which use `let` and anonymous procedures together.
- Reloading a model now clears global variables.
- Clearer warning dialogs when opening an older version of a NetLogo 2D file in NetLogo 3D.
- Using `foreach` improperly in the Command Center will display the same error as it would if used improperly in the code tab.
- Extremely long anonymous procedures no longer cause an exception when compiled.
- `in-radius` is no longer pathologically slow on agentsets created using `with`.

### Extension Changes

- A new primitive, `table:values` has been added to the table extension.
- The R extension has been updated to take full advantage of the JavaGD R library using `r:setPlotDevice`.
- Users can now supply a path to the R extension by configuring the value of r.lib.paths in the user.properties file.
- Fixed a LevelSpace bug preventing interactive models from using nls files.
- Fixed a LevelSpace bug causing NetLogo to lock up when trying to load a nonexistent file as an interactive model.

### Documentation Changes

- The system dynamics tutorial now instructs the user to set the `dt` to a value which gives stable behavior
- The documentation for `follow`, `ride`, and `watch` has been clarified to indicate that calling one undoes highlights and perspective changes caused by the other
- The documentation for `=` and `!=` indicates that they work with extension objects.
- Several examples have been added to `sort` clarifying the behavior of `sort` on lists featuring different types of objects.
- A new [section on User Interface primitives](programming.html#user-interaction-primitives) has been added to the programming guide which discusses the behavior of the "Halt" button in the various user interaction dialogs.
- Incorrect example code for `foreach` and `reduce` has been corrected.

### Models

All models have been updated to reflect the new optional nature of brackets for
zero/one argument anonymous procedures. This resulted in changes to 108 models.

All models have been updated to reflect the availability of the new range
primitive. This resulted in changes to 12 models.

## Version 6.0 (December 2016)

### Feature Changes

- The NetLogo code editor now offers autocompletion support. Simply press the Control key and the spacebar at the same time while typing a word and you will see a list of similar NetLogo primitives as suggestions.
- The NetLogo code editor offers the option to "fold" procedures to make navigating large models simpler.
- NetLogo supports multi-level agent-based modeling with the LevelSpace extension
- Line numbering can be enabled in the NetLogo code editor by choosing "Show Line Numbers" from the "Preferences" dialog. This dialog can be opened by selecting "NetLogo" > "Preferences" in Mac, or "Tools" > "Preferences" on Linux or Windows.
- The view resizing arrows have been removed and the tick counter has been relocated under the speed slider.
- When editing NetLogo code, users can right-click a variable name or primitive and choose "Show Usage" to see all usages of that name in the file.
- When editing NetLogo code, users can right-click a variable name and choose "Jump to Declaration" to see where in the file that variable is declared.
- The NetLogo interface editor now supports "Undo" for widget addition, deletion, and movement.
- NetLogo can export code to HTML with code-colorization by choosing "Export Code" in the "Export" section of the "File" menu.
- The look and feel of NetLogo on Mac OS X has changed significantly. NetLogo is now using the Oracle-supplied Java look and feel as opposed to a third-party look and feel used in prior versions.
- Plots use a random number generator independent of the main-model random number generator.
- Model Preview Commands can be edited through the GUI by choosing "Preview Commands Editor" in the "Tools" menu. Those commands generate the preview image that appears when you upload your model to the Modeling Commons.
- NetLogo displays a more helpful error message when a program fails due to an "out of memory" error.
- NetLogo and its bundled extensions are now compiled against Java 8 and Scala 2.12.
- NetLogo has upgraded the ASM bytecode library to enable generation of Java 8 bytecode.

### Bugfixes

- `*-link-neighbor?` primitives now work the same way for breeded and unbreeded links.
- Resizing the world in NetLogo 3D no longer causes a black view.
- Fixed error caused by right-clicking a widget while dragging.
- Improved error message when a user-defined procedure shadows a breed procedure.
- `neighbors4` and `neighbors` no longer report agentsets containing the same patch more than once.

### Language Changes

- Support for plural-only breed names (e.g., `breed [mice]`) has been removed. Write `breed [mice mouse]` instead.
- Tasks have been replaced by anonymous procedures. Tasks made use of `?` variables which were confusing for novices and difficult to read for experts. Additionally, tasks could not refer to the task variables of a containing task. Anonymous procedures may have named arguments which can be accessed by inner anonymous tasks. Upon first opening a NetLogo 5 model in NetLogo 6, tasks like `task [ ?1 + ?2 ]` will be automatically converted to `[ [?1 ?2] -> ?1 + ?2 ]`. See the [the transition guide](transition.html) for more information.
- Link reporters have been overhauled to be more consistent and flexible
- The `task` primitive is no longer supported.
- Breed names that conflict with language primitives are now disallowed. For instance, `breed [strings string]` is now disallowed since it makes `is-string?` ambiguous.
- The compiler errors on duplicated breed singular names.
- The compiler detects a greater number of type errors, for instance `not pxcor` now raises a compiler error instead of erroring at runtime.
- `set-plot-pen-color` now accepts RGB lists as arguments.
- The `hubnet-set-client-interface` primitive has been removed.
- The various primitives starting with `movie-` have been removed, as has the movie encoder. They have been replaced with the new `vid` extension. [The transition guide](transition.html) provides more details and information.
- The `__change-language` primitive has been removed. You can now change the User Interface Language through the preferences dialog, which can be found by choosing "Preferences..." in the "NetLogo" menu (Mac OS X) or in the "Tools" menu (all other platforms).
- The string representation of anonymous procedures displays the body of the anonymous procedure.

### Extension Changes

- NetLogo 6.0 comes with three new, bundled extensions: LevelSpace `ls`, the `vid` extension for video manipulation, and the enhanced visualization extension `view2.5d`.
- `ls` enables multi-level agent-based modeling in NetLogo.
- The Extensions API has been updated from 5.0 to 6.0. This means that all non-bundled extensions will need to be updated to use the new API. Extensions written for NetLogo 5 *will not* work in NetLogo 6. If you're an extension author, see [the extension author transition guide for 6.0](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/6.0-Extension-and-Controlling-API-Transition-Guide) for more information. If you regularly use extensions you may want to contact their authors to inform them a new version of NetLogo is on the way and they may want to update their extensions.
- `arduino:get` (in the arduino extension) correctly reports values from Windows 64-bit machines. In prior versions it would only report some values correctly.
- Several new features have been added to the `nw` extension:
    - Added community detection using the Louvain method
    - Added modularity measurement
    - Added Watts-Strogatz small-world network generation
    - Made other network generation algorithms easier to layout
    - Weighted primitives now take symbolic variable names instead of strings. See [the transition guide](transition.html) for more information.
- The `qtj` extension is no longer bundled with NetLogo. Users are encouraged to make use of the [new `vid` extension](vid.html).
- The new `vid` extension is now bundled with NetLogo, combining features of the late `qtj` extension and the movie primitives.
- The network extension is no longer bundled with NetLogo. Users are encouraged to use the `nw` extension ([https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/nw.html](nw.html)), which has been bundled with NetLogo for some time.
- The `gogo-serial` extension is no longer bundled with NetLogo. Users are encouraged to transition to the newer `gogo` extension, which uses HID to communicate with the GoGo board.

### Operating System Support

- NetLogo will now be used to open `.nlogo` links in PowerPoint and other programs on Microsoft Windows.
- The NetLogo binaries on Mac OS X are installed as runnable by any user.
- NetLogo in Mac OS X will not use "App Nap" while running. This keeps simulations running at full speed when NetLogo is in the background.
- The NetLogo controlling API has changed since NetLogo 5. Programs that rely on the controlling API (such as BehaviorSearch) will not work until they have been changed to match the new API.

### Documentation Changes

- New documentation for anonymous procedures
- The NetLogo tutorial screenshots have been updated to correspond to the new Mac OS X Look and Feel.
- The NetLogo dictionary displays the version in which each primitive was introduced next to that primitive.
- A Spanish translation of the NetLogo dictionary is available [here](diccionario.pdf)

### Internationalization Changes

- A new Spanish translation of the NetLogo dictionary is available [as part of the NetLogo manual](diccionario.pdf).
- Language preferences can be changed by using the new "Preferences" menu instead of the `__change-language` primitive.
