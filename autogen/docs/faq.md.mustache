## General

### Why is it called NetLogo?

The "Logo" part is because NetLogo is a dialect of the Logo
language.

"Net" is meant to evoke the decentralized, interconnected
nature of the phenomena you can model with NetLogo, including network
phenomena. It also refers to HubNet, the multiuser participatory
simulation environment included in NetLogo.

### How do I cite NetLogo or HubNet in a publication?

If you use or refer to NetLogo, HubNet or a model from the NetLogo
models library, we ask that you cite it as follows:

*NetLogo itself:* Wilensky, U. 1999. NetLogo. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/.
Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling,
Northwestern University. Evanston, IL.

*HubNet:* Wilensky, U. & Stroup, W., 1999. HubNet. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/hubnet.html.
Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling,
Northwestern University. Evanston, IL.

### How do I cite a model from the Models Library in a publication?

The correct citation is included in the "Credits and References" section of each
model's Info tab.

### Where and when was NetLogo created?

NetLogo was first created in 1999 by Uri Wilensky at the Center for
Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling, then at Tufts University in the
Boston area. NetLogo grew out of StarLogoT, which was authored by Wilensky in
1997. In 2000, the CCL moved to Northwestern University, in the Chicago area.
NetLogo 1.0 came out in 2002, 2.0 in 2003, 3.0 in 2005, 4.0 in 2007, 4.1 in
2009, and 5.0 in 2012.

### What programming language was NetLogo written in?

NetLogo is written mostly in Scala, with some parts in Java. (Scala code
compiles to Java byte code and is fully interoperable with Java and other JVM
languages.)

### What's the relationship between StarLogo and NetLogo?

The original StarLogo began at the MIT Media Lab in 1989 and ran on the
Connection Machine. Later versions were developed for Macintosh computers:
MacStarLogo (1994, MIT) and StarLogoT (1997, Tufts).

Today there are two StarLogo descendants under active development: NetLogo (from
the CCL at Northwestern University) and StarLogo TNG (from MIT). NetLogo is the
most widely used agent-based modeling environment in both education and
research. StarLogo TNG is distinguished by its programming interface based on
colored blocks.

### Under what license is NetLogo released? Is the source code available?

### Do you offer any workshops or other training opportunities for NetLogo?

We offer workshops from time to time. If a workshop has been scheduled, we will
announce it on the
[NetLogo Users Group](https://groups.yahoo.com/group/netlogo-users/).

### Are there any NetLogo textbooks?

The CCL has published a textbook (written by the author of NetLogo) that gives
an introduction to agent-based modeling methods using NetLogo. It goes step by
step with coding examples how to design, build, revise, and analyze models. And
it presents some advanced techniques.

See [www.intro-to-abm.com](http://www.intro-to-abm.com) for more information on
that textbook.

See the Textbooks section of our
[Resources](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/resources.shtml) page.

We at the CCL have hoped to write several more NetLogo textbooks. These could be
aimed at different audiences, such as: middle school, high school, undergraduate
course in modeling or complexity, practical guide for interested adults.

Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to find the time to make these happen.
If anyone from the user community would like to collaborate on such a venture,
please let us know. We would welcome it.

### Is NetLogo available in other languages besides English?

Volunteers have translated the user manual into Chinese and Czech. The
translated versions are available from the NetLogo web site.

So far, the NetLogo user interface has been localized in English, Spanish,
Chinese, Russian, and Japanese. All five languages are included in the standard
download.

We are seeking volunteers to complete and improve these localizations and to
translate the NetLogo software and manual into as many other languages as
possible. If you're able to help in this endeavor, please
[contact us](contact.html).

### Is NetLogo compiled or interpreted?

Short answer: some of both.

Long answer: NetLogo does include a compiler that generates Java byte code.
However, this compiler does not yet support the entire language, so some parts
of user code remain interpreted. Note that our compiler generates Java byte
code, and Java virtual machines have "just-in-time" compilers that in turn
compile Java byte code all the way to native code, so much user code is
ultimately translated to native code.

### Has anyone built a model of \<x>?

Try looking at the
[NetLogo Models Library](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/), the
[NetLogo Modeling Commons](http://modelingcommons.org/), our
[Community Models](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/) page,
and our
[list of references to NetLogo in outside works](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/references.shtml).

You might also ask the question on the
[NetLogo Users Group](https://groups.yahoo.com/group/netlogo-users/) and/or search past messages on the group.

### Are NetLogo models runs scientifically reproducible?

Yes. NetLogo's pseudorandom number generator and agent scheduling algorithms are
deterministic, and NetLogo always uses Java's "strict math" library, which gives
bit-for-bit identical results regardless of platform. But keep the following
cautions in mind:

- If your model uses random numbers, then in order to get reproducible behavior,
  you must use the `random-seed` command to set the random seed in advance, so
  that your model will receive the exact same sequence of random numbers every
  time. Remember that agentsets are always in random order, so anything you do
  with agentsets uses random numbers.
- If your model uses the `every` or `wait` commands in such a way that affects
  the outcome of the model, then you may get different results on different
  computers, or even on the same computer, since the model may run at a
  different speed.
- In order to reproduce model runs exactly, you must be using the exact same
  version of NetLogo. The details of the agent scheduling mechanism and the
  random number generator may change between NetLogo versions, and other changes
  (bugfixes in the engine, language changes, and so forth) may also affect the
  behavior of your model. (Then again, they may not.)
- We have expended every effort to make NetLogo model runs fully reproducible,
  but of course this can never truly be an iron-clad guarantee, due not only to
  the possibility of random hardware failure, but also the possibility of human
  error in the design of: your model, NetLogo, your Java VM, your hardware, and
  so on.

### Will NetLogo unify 2D and 3D modes?

As of 6.1, NetLogo now has one application capable of interacting with 2D or 3D
models, but switching between 2D and 3D modes is still somewhat clunky
Ideally, we would design the 3D mode support so it doesn't get in the
way when you are building 2D models. We welcome suggestions about how to
improve and enhance this aspect of modeling.

### Can I run NetLogo on my phone or tablet?

No. Neither iOS, nor Android, nor Windows RT supports running Java applications
such as NetLogo.

We are working on an alternate implementation of NetLogo on a JavaScript and
HTML5 base, instead of Java. It will work on a variety of tablets and phones. We
don't know yet when it will be ready, and we expect that for a long time it will
only support a subset of the features in desktop NetLogo. The many person-years
of development effort that have gone into the Java version can't cheaply or
easily be replicated on another platform.

For technical details on this new project, go
[here](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Tortoise).

## Downloading

### Can I have multiple versions of NetLogo installed at the same time?

Yes. When you install NetLogo, the folder that is created contains has the
version number in its name, so multiple versions can coexist.

On Windows systems, whichever version you installed last will be the version
that opens when you double click a model file in Windows Explorer. On Macs, you
can control what version opens via "Get Info" in the Finder.

### I'm on a UNIX system and I can't untar the download. Why?

Some of the files in the tarball have long pathnames, too long for the standard
tar format. You must use the GNU version of tar instead (or another program
which understands the GNU tar extensions). On some systems, the GNU version of
tar is available under the name "gnutar". You can find out if you are already
using the GNU version by typing `tar --version` and seeing if the output says
"tar (GNU tar)".

### How do I install NetLogo unattended?

It depends on which platform you are using.

- **Linux:** Untar NetLogo into the appropriate place.
- **Mac:** Copy the NetLogo directory from the disk image into the Applications
  folder.
- **Windows:** The installer is an MSI which can be run  using one of the following commands (these may require admin privileges):

        msiexec.exe /i C:\Path\to\NetLogo.msi ALLUSERS=1 ADDLOCAL=Shortcuts   :: To install with desktop shortcuts
        msiexec.exe /i C:\Path\to\NetLogo.msi ALLUSERS=1 ADDLOCAL=BaseInstall :: To install without desktop shortcuts

We also maintain an [advanced installation wiki page](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Advanced-Installation)
which may have additional tips and tricks.
We encourage users who have problems with unattended installation or ideas on
how it could be improved to email [feedback@ccl.northwestern.edu](mailto:feedback@ccl.northwestern.edu?subject=Unattended%20Installation).

## Running

### Can I run NetLogo from a CD, a network drive, or a USB drive?

Yes. NetLogo runs fine from any file system, including read-only file systems.

### Why is NetLogo so much slower when I unplug my Windows laptop?

Your computer is switching to power saving mode when unplugged. It's normal for
this to reduce speed a little, but unfortunately there is a bug in Java that
drastically slows down Swing applications, including NetLogo.

One workaround is to change the power settings on your computer so it doesn't go
into power saving mode when you unplug it. (If you do this, your battery won't
last as long.)

Another workaround is to run NetLogo with an option recommended by Oracle, by
editing the NetLogo {{version}}.vmoptions file, found in the NetLogo directory
(under Program Files on your hard drive, unless you installed NetLogo in a
different location). Add on a new line:

    -Dsun.java2d.ddoffscreen=false

You can see the details of the Java bug and vote for Oracle to fix it
[here](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id).

### Why does NetLogo bundle Java?

Since Mac OS X Lion, Apple have encouraged Mac application developers to bundle
Java. NetLogo bundles Java because it allows us to deliver a consistent,
convenient experience to our users. Bundling Java allows us to test for
compatibility once and avoid any bugs caused by version mismatches or Java
configuration incompatibilities.

If users are interested in using Java on their system instead of the version of
Java bundled with NetLogo, they can configure NetLogo to use a different Java
runtime. Please note that **this change is done at your own risk**. We are
unable to offer support for problems caused by running NetLogo with an alternate
Java Runtime. To change the Java runtime used by NetLogo, open the
[NetLogo.cfg](#where-is-cfg-file) file and modify the `app.runtime` property to
the path of your preferred Java Runtime.

### How come NetLogo won't start up on my Linux machine?

We bundle Oracle's Java runtime when using NetLogo on Linux. If you would like
to change the version of linux used, you can modify the .cfg files to point to a
different version of java (see
[How big can my model be?](#how-big-can-my-model-be-how-many-turtles-patches-procedures-buttons-and-so-on-can-my-model-contain)
for more information).

In theory, any Java 8 or later runtime will run NetLogo. In practice, some Java
implementations aren't high enough quality. Recent versions of OpenJDK should
work; older ones may not. GNU libgcj does not work.

Ubuntu users should consult https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java.

### When I try to install NetLogo on Windows, I see "Windows protected your PC"

Windows attempts to protect users from downloading malicious software by
maintaining a list of "good" and "malicious" software. The first users to
install any NetLogo release will see this warning. Later users may or may not
see this warning. Before going any further, ensure you are protected. The CCL
can only vouch for NetLogo downloads hosted on the CCL Website. NetLogo can be
freely downloaded from
[the official NetLogo download page](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml).
If you obtain NetLogo from anywhere else, you install it at your own risk!

You can continue past the Windows prompt by taking the following steps:

- In the "Windows protected your PC" prompt, click "More Info", the prompt will
  change
- In the changed prompt, click "Run Anyway" and continue with installation as
  normal

Note in order to see the "More Info" or "Run Anyway" options, you will need to
run the installer as an administrator. If you do not see those options,
right-click and choose "Run as administrator" and/or change your user account to
an administrator account before installing.

We at the CCL are working on solving this problem and hope to free our users of
the added installation difficulty soon!

### When I try to start NetLogo on Windows I get an error "The JVM could not be started". Help!

A nearly certain fix is to use a text editor to edit the NetLogo.cfg file,
changing 1024m to a smaller number, like 512m. This should permit NetLogo to
start, although the lower heap size limit may affect your ability to run models
with many agents. See
[How big can my model be?](#how-big-can-my-model-be-how-many-turtles-patches-procedures-buttons-and-so-on-can-my-model-contain)
for information on model size and how to edit the cfg file.

If running with the lower heap size limit is unacceptable, read on.

Some Windows systems have trouble allocating large amounts of contiguous virtual
memory. Upgrading to a newer version of Windows may help.

Running Windows in 64-bit mode instead of 32-bit mode may also help. Double
check that Windows is actually running in 64-bit mode; see
[Microsoft's FAQ page on 64-bit Windows](https://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions).

### NetLogo won't start on Mac OS Sierra (or later)

Some users have reported problems opening NetLogo 6 on Mac OS Sierra. We've been
unable to determine a root cause for this problem, but we're continuing to
investigate. We're looking for assistance from you if you run into this problem.
It would be extremely helpful if you could run the following command in the
"Terminal" application and send the output in an email to
[bugs@ccl.northwestern.edu](mailto:bugs@ccl.northwestern.edu?subject=Sierra%20NetLogo%206%20Bug).

    xattr -pl com.apple.quarantine /Applications/NetLogo\ {{version}}/NetLogo\ {{version}}.app

running it should give you a single line of output (something like
`com.apple.quarantine: 01e1;58ac6af2;Firefox;F2E0B1E2-D203-4B05-8DF9-ABA58B52EFEA`,
but yours will have different numbers, letters, and words). Please copy and
paste this string into the email you send us.

There is also a partial workaround! Running the following command in the
Terminal will enable users to run NetLogo without turning Gatekeeper completely
off. The command is:

    sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/NetLogo\ {{version}}/NetLogo\ {{version}}.app

Note that if you plan to run Behaviorsearch, HubNet Client, or NetLogo Logging, you
may also need to re-run that command once for each of those applications. If the
workaround was not effective for you, please
[send us an email and let us know](mailto:bugs@ccl.northwestern.edu?subject=Sierra%20NetLogo%206%20Bug%20Workaround).

### NetLogo won't start on Windows or crashes suddenly on Mac OS Sierra

Some users on Mac OS with discrete graphics cards experience sudden crashes of
NetLogo when switching between integrated and discrete graphics. It's possible
to prevent these crashes by
[disabling automatic graphics switching in System Preferences](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202043).

Some Windows users may also be unable to open NetLogo due to graphics card
settings or drivers. If you are unable to open NetLogo on Windows, you might be
able to fix this by updating or reinstalling your graphics driver and/or
disabling any graphics card utilities. Because NetLogo might be unable to start
for a number of reasons, we encourage you to
[contact us](mailto:bugs@ccl.northwestern.edu?subject=NetLogo%206%20Launch%20Problem%20in%20Windows)
if these steps aren't effective in resolving the problem.

### Can I run NetLogo from the command line, without the GUI?

Yes. The easiest way is to set up your model run or runs as a BehaviorSpace
experiment. No additional programming is required. See the
[BehaviorSpace Guide](behaviorspace.html) for details.

Another option is to use our Controlling API. Some light Java programming is
required. See the
[Controlling API Guide](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Controlling-API)
for details and sample code.

### Does NetLogo take advantage of multiple processors?

Only when using BehaviorSpace. BehaviorSpace does parallel runs, one per
processor.

For a single model run, only one processor is used.

We are seeking funding to make it possible to split a single model run across
multiple processors or multiple computers.

### Can I distribute NetLogo model runs across a cluster or grid of computers?

Many of the same comments in the previous answer apply. It is not possible to
split a single model run across multiple computers, but you can have each
machine in a cluster doing one or more separate, independent model runs, using
either BehaviorSpace or our Controlling API. We don't have automated support for
splitting the runs across clusters, so you'll need to arrange that yourself.

Various users are already using NetLogo on clusters, with a variety of hardware
and software. You can seek them out on the
[NetLogo Users Group](https://groups.yahoo.com/group/netlogo-users/).

### Is there any way to recover lost work if NetLogo crashes or freezes?

Yes. NetLogo auto-saves files as you are working on them. The path to the
auto-save file depends on whether or not the NetLogo model has been saved.

For NetLogo models which have been saved, a hidden file with the name
".*filename*.tmp.nlogox" will be created in the same directory as the NetLogo
model.

For unsaved NetLogo models, autosave files can be found in your OS-specific java
temporary directory. The files are named according to the following format:
`autosave_yyyy-MM-dd.HH_mm_ss.nlogox` where the time and date are the time and
date the model was opened. The exact path will depend on your operating system:

- On Mac OS, the temporary directory is
  `/var/folders/68/<30-character-alphanumeric-sequence>/T/`. The
  30-character-alphanumeric-sequence is unique to each machine.
- On Windows the logs can be found in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp`,
  where `<user>` is the logged in user.
- On most non-Mac Unix-like systems the temp directory is `/tmp`.

## Usage

### When I move the speed slider all the way to the right, why does my model seem to stop?

The only way NetLogo can make your model run faster is by updating the view less
frequently. As you move the speed slider to the right, view updates become less
and less frequent. Since view updates take time, that means more speed.

However, fewer updates also means that the updates come farther apart. When
several seconds pass between updates, it may seem like your model has stopped.
It hasn't. It's running at full speed. Watch the tick counter! (If your model
uses it. If it doesn't, watch something else, like a plot.)

To get a feel for what's going on, try moving the slider to the right gradually
rather than suddenly. If you find the updates too infrequent at the rightmost
position, just don't push the slider that far.

### Can I use the mouse to "paint" in the view?

NetLogo does not have a built-in set of painting tools for painting in the view.
But with only a few lines of code, you can add painting capability to your
model. To see how it's done, look at Mouse Example, in the Code Examples section
of the Models Library. The same techniques can be used to let the user interact
with your model using the mouse in other ways, too.

Another possibility is to create an image in another program and import it using
the import items on the File menu or the `import-*` primitives.

### How big can my model be? How many turtles, patches, procedures, buttons, and so on can my model contain?

We have tested NetLogo with models that use hundreds of megabytes of RAM and
they work fine. We haven't tested models that use gigabytes of RAM, though.
Theoretically it should work, but you might hit some limits that are inherent in
the underlying Java VM and/or operating system (either designed-in limits, or
bugs).

The NetLogo engine has no fixed limits on size. By default, though, NetLogo
ships with a one-gigabyte ceiling on how much total RAM it can use. If your
model exceeds that limit, you'll get an OutOfMemoryError dialog.

If you are using BehaviorSpace, note that doing runs in parallel will multiply
your RAM usage accordingly.

<a id="where-is-cfg-file"></a>
Each platform contains ".cfg" files containing JVM settings. There is one cfg
file for each sub-application (NetLogo, HubNet Client, etc.)
Although the file location varies by platform, the process for changing it is
the same. Locate the section of the file that looks like the following:

    [JVMOptions]
    # there may be one or more lines, leave them unchanged
    -Xmx1024m
    # there may be one or more lines, leave them unchanged

Modify the value immediately following `-Xmx`, changing it to the amount of
space you need, save the file, and restart NetLogo. Platform specific notes
follow:

- **Windows:** The cfg files will be in
  `C:\Program Files (x86)\NetLogo {{version}}\app` if you are running 64-bit
  windows, and `C:\Program Files\NetLogo {{version}}\app` otherwise.
- **Mac OS X:** The file for NetLogo will be located at:
  `/Application/NetLogo {{version}}/NetLogo.app/Contents/Java/NetLogo.cfg` For
  HubNet Client and the other applications, you will find the file in the
  corresponding location for each application package. You can reach the cfg
  file by control-clicking the application in the Finder and choosing "Show
  Package Contents" from the popup menu.
  
    Please note that depending on your version of Mac OS X, changing the cfg file
    *may* break application signing. If this happens, follow Apple's directions on
    [this page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) to temporarily allow
    apps from "Anywhere", run NetLogo once, then restore the setting to "Mac App
    Store and Identified Developers".
- **Other:** The cfg files will be located in the `netlogo-{{version}}/app`
  folder after untarring.

By default, Mac builds of NetLogo bundle a 64-bit JVM, which should be able to
make use of as much memory as the lesser of available system memory and the
value following `-Xmx`. Windows and Linux will bundle a 32-bit or 64-bit JVM,
depending on which version you have downloaded. It is recommended that you
install 64-bit NetLogo on all 64-bit operating systems for best performance.

### Can I use GIS data in NetLogo?

Yes, many users are using GIS data with NetLogo. The most complete way to do
that is with the GIS extension. See the [GIS Extension Guide](gis.html).

A simpler way is to use `import-pcolors`, but that only works for importing maps
that are images, not maps in other formats.

It is also possible to write NetLogo code that reads GIS data using our file I/O
primitives such as `file-open`. For example, see the Grand Canyon model in the
Earth Science section of Sample Models.

### My model runs slowly. How can I speed it up?

Here's some ways to make it run faster without changing the structure of the
code:

- Use tick-based view updates, not continuous updates.
- Decrease the frequency of view updates by pushing the speed slider to the
  right, or turn updates off using the checkbox.
- If your model is using all available RAM on your computer, then installing
  more RAM should help. If your hard drive makes a lot of noise while your model
  is running, you probably need more RAM.
- Use turtle size 1, 1.5, or 2, as the 2D renderings for these sizes are cached
  by NetLogo. (This only affects graphics speed in the 2D view, not computation
  speed.)

In many cases, though, if you want your model to run faster, you may need to
make some changes to the code. Usually the most obvious opportunity for speedup
is that you're doing too many computations that involve all the turtles or all
the patches. Often this can be reduced by reworking the model so that it does
less computation per time step. The members of the
[NetLogo Users Group](https://groups.yahoo.com/group/netlogo-users/) may be able
to help with this.

The [profiler extension](profiler.html) is useful for identifying which parts of
your code are taking the most time.

Unless you are running the exact same strings over and over, using `run` and
`runresult` are much slower than running code directly; you should avoid using
these primitives on fresh strings in performance-critical code.

### Can I have more than one model open at a time?

One instance of NetLogo can only have one model open at a time. (Unfortunately,
it is unlikely that this will change in a future version, due to the engineering
difficulties involved.)

You can have multiple models open by opening multiple instances of NetLogo,
though. On Windows and Linux, simply start the application again. On a Mac,
you'll need to duplicate the application (not the whole folder, just the
application itself) in the Finder, then open the copy. (The copy takes up only a
very small amount of additional disk space.)

### Can I change the choices in a chooser on the fly?

No.

### Can I divide the code for my model up into several files?

On an experimental basis, this is available using the `__includes` keyword.

## Programming

### How does the NetLogo language differ from other Logos?

This is answered in detail at the end of the [Programming Guide](programming.html).

### How come my model from an earlier NetLogo doesn't work right?

See the [Transition Guide](transition.html) for help.

### How do I take the negative of a number?

Any of these ways:

    (- x)
    -1 * x
    0 - x

With the first way, the parentheses are required.

### My turtle moved forward 1, but it's still on the same patch. Why?

If you have disabled wrapping at the world edges in your model, then the turtle
might be at a world edge and unable to move any further. You can test for this
using `can-move?`.

Assuming the turtle isn't hitting a world edge, moving forward 1 is only
guaranteed to take a turtle to a new patch if the turtle's heading is a multiple
of 90 (that is, exactly north, south, east, or west).

It's because the turtle might not be standing in the center of a patch. It might
be near the corner of a patch. For example, suppose your turtle is close to the
southwest corner of a patch and is facing northeast. The length of the patch
diagonal is 1.414... (the square root of two), so `fd 1` will leave the turtle
near the northeast corner of the same patch.

If you don't want to have to think about these issues, one possibility is to
write your model in such a way that your turtles always come to rest on patch
centers. See next question.

### How do I keep my turtles on patch centers?

A turtle is on a patch center when its `xcor` and `ycor` are integers.

You can move a turtle to the center of its current patch with either of these
two equivalent commands:

    move-to patch-here
    setxy pxcor pycor

But you'll never need to do that if you never allow turtles off of patch centers
in the first place.

The `sprout` command creates turtles on patch centers. For example:

    ask n-of 50 patches [ sprout 1 [ face one-of neighbors4 ] ]

Another way for a turtle to start on a patch center is with a command such as
this line of turtle code, which moves it to the center of a random patch:

    move-to one-of patches

Once a turtle is on a patch center, as long as its heading always stays an exact
multiple of 90 (that is to say, due north, east, south, or west), and as it long
as it moves forward or back by integer amounts, it will always land on patch
centers.

See Random Grid Walk Example, in the Code Examples section of the Models
Library, to see these code snippets in use.

### `patch-ahead 1` is reporting the same patch my turtle is already standing on. Why?

See the answer two answers up. It's the same issue.

This might not be the meaning of "ahead" you were expecting. With `patch-ahead`,
you must specify the distance ahead that you want to look. If you want to know
the next patch a turtle would cross into if it moved forward continuously, it is
possible to find that out. See Next Patch Example, in the Code Examples section
of the Models Library.

### How do I give my turtles "vision"?

You can use `in-radius` to let a turtle see a circular area around it.

Several primitives let the turtle "look" at specific points. The `patch-ahead`
primitive is useful for letting a turtle see what is directly in front of it. If
you want the turtle to look in another direction besides straight ahead, try
`patch-left-and-ahead` and `patch-right-and-ahead`.

If you want the turtle to have a full "cone" of vision, use the `in-cone`
primitive.

You can also find out the next patch a turtle would cross into if it moved
forward continuously. See Next Patch Example, in the Code Examples section of
the Models Library.

### Can agents sense what's in the drawing layer?

No. If you want to make marks that agents can sense, use patch colors.

### I'm getting numbers like 0.10000000004 and 0.799999999999 instead of 0.1 and 0.8. Why?

See the ["Math" section of the Programming Guide](programming.html#math) for a
discussion of this issue.

### The documentation says that `random-float 1` might return 0 but will never return 1. What if I want 1 to be included?

It really doesn't matter. Even if 1 were a possible result, it would only come
up approximately 1 in 2^64 tries, which means you'd be waiting hundreds of years
before it ever came up exactly 1.

Nonetheless, if you are convinced that it really must be possible to get 1, you
can use `precision` to round your answer to a certain number of decimal places.
For example:

    print precision (random-float 1) 10
    0.2745173723

(If you use this method, note that 0 and 1 are only half as likely to come up as
other answers. To see why this is so, consider the case where you only keep one
digit after the decimal point. Results between 0 and 0.5 get rounded to 0, but
results between 0.5 and 1.5 get rounded to 1; the latter range is twice as
large. If you want 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, and 1 to all be equally likely, an
alternative is to write `random 11 / 10`; this gives all 11 answers with equal
probability.)

### How can I keep two turtles from occupying the same patch?

See One Turtle Per Patch Example, in the Code Examples section of the Models
Library.

### How can I find out if a turtle is dead?

When a turtle dies, it turns into `nobody`. `nobody` is a special value used in
NetLogo used to indicate the absence of a turtle or patch. So for example:

    if turtle 0 != nobody [ ... ]

You could also use `is-turtle?`:

    if is-turtle? turtle 0 [ ... ]

### Does NetLogo have arrays?

Nearly all models should just use lists for this.

The usual motivation for using arrays in other programming languages is that
they provide fast random access (`item`) and mutation (`replace-item`). But
NetLogo's lists, even though they are immutable, now provide near constant time
performance on these operations.

Lists in earlier versions of NetLogo (4.1 and 4.0) were simple singly-linked
lists and therefore these operations took linear time. The data structure
underlying NetLogo's lists now is the immutable Vector class from the Scala
collections library. It uses 32-wide
[hash array mapped tries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie),
as implemented by Tiark Rompf, based in part on work by Phil Bagwell and Rich
Hickey.

If you are certain you want to use raw, mutable JVM arrays in your model, they
are provided by the array extension. See the Arrays & Tables section of the User
Manual.

### Does NetLogo have hash tables or associative arrays?

Yes, using the table extension. See the Arrays & Tables section of the User
Manual.

### How can I use different patch "neighborhoods" (circular, Von Neumann, Moore, etc.)?

The `in-radius` primitives lets you access circular neighborhoods of any radius.

The `neighbors` primitive gives you a Moore neighborhood of radius 1, and the
`neighbors4` primitive gives you a Von Neumann neighborhood of radius 1.

For Moore or Von Neumann neighborhoods of a larger radius, see Moore & Von
Neumann Example in the Code Examples section of the Models Library.

### How can I convert an agentset to a list of agents, or vice versa?

If you want the list in a particular order, use the `sort` or `sort-by`
primitives. The Lists section of the Programming Guide explains how to do this.
See also Ask Ordering Example, in the Code Examples section of the Models
Library.

If you want the list in a random order, here's how:

    [self] of <agentset>

Because all operations on agentsets are in random order, the resulting list is
in random order.

To convert a list of agents to an agentset, use the `turtle-set`, `patch-set`,
or `link-set` primitives.

### How do I stop foreach?

To stop a foreach from executing you need to define a separate procedure that
contains only the foreach, for example:

    to test
      foreach [1 2 3] [ i ->
        if i = 2 [ stop ]
        print i
      ]
    end

This code will only print the number 1. The `stop` returns from the current
procedure so nothing after the foreach will be executed either. (If the
procedure is a reporter procedure, use `report` instead of `stop`.)

### I'm trying to make a list. Why do I keep getting the error "Expected a constant"?

If a list contains only constants, you can write it down just by putting square
brackets around it, like `[1 2 3]`.

If you want your list to contain items that may vary at runtime, the list cannot
be written down directly. Instead, you build it using the
[list](dictionary.html#list) primitive.

## BehaviorSpace

### Why are the rows in my BehaviorSpace table results out of order?

This is normal when doing multiple runs in parallel. For a discussion of the
issue, see the section on parallel runs in the
[BehaviorSpace Guide](behaviorspace.html) section of the User Manual.

### How do I measure runs every n ticks?

Use `repeat` in your experiment's go commands, e.g.:

    repeat 10 [ go ]

to measure the run after every 10 ticks. Essentially you are making one
experiment step equal 10 ticks.

### I'm varying a global variable I declared in the Code tab, but it doesn't work. Why?

It's probably because your setup commands or setup procedure are using
`clear-all`, causing the values set by BehaviorSpace to be cleared.

One possible workaround is to change your experiment's setup commands to
preserve the value of the variable, e.g.:

    let old-var1 var1
    setup
    set var1 old-var1

This works because even `clear-all` doesn't clear the values of local variables
made with `let`

Another possible workaround is to change your model's setup procedure to use
more specific clearing commands to clear only what you want cleared.

## 3D Mode

### Does NetLogo work with my stereoscopic device?

NetLogo supports fullscreen exclusive mode. If that is all your device needs
then, possibly yes. However, it can be tricky to get it working. We don't have
any such devices so it is difficult for us to make the process easier. If your
device needs something else, for example, quadbuffers enabled, the answer is
probably no.

## Extensions

### I'm writing an extension. Why does the compiler say it can't find `org.nlogo.api`?

You need to add NetLogo.jar to your classpath when compiling. `NetLogo.jar` is
included with NetLogo.
