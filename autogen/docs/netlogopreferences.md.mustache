## Overview
This dialog lets you customize various NetLogo settings. On Windows and
Linux, it is opened with the Tools menu “Preferences...” item. For Macs,
it’s under the “NetLogo” menu and reads “Settings”.

Items are organized into four tabs:

- [General Preferences](#general-preferences)
- [Code Preferences](#code-preferences)
- [Logging Preferences](#logging-preferences)
- [Color Themes](#color-themes)

Use the check boxes or pull-down menus to change the default preference
values. When you are done, click the OK button to save your changes, or
the Cancel button to revert the preferences to the state they were in
before you opened the dialog. Most preferences take effect immediately.
You must exit and re-open NetLogo for the preferences that indicate
“(restart required)” to take effect. There is one preference that only
takes effect when the user opens a new model, or re-opens the current
model, as indicated by the note “(model reload required)”.


## General Preferences

### User Interface language
Choose a language for user interface items and error messages. (restart required)
```
Choices: English, Spanish, Chinese,  Portuguese, Russian, and Japanese
```
### Reload the last used model on startup
NetLogo opens with an empty model by default. When this option is selected the previously opened
model will be loaded when NetLogo starts.

### Reload model on external changes
If you use an editor outside of NetLogo to change the model or any included .nls files, the
changed file is updated in NetLogo.

### Bold widget text
By default, widget text is not in bold, use this option to bold it. (model reload required)

### Jump slider widget thumb to mouse location on click (instead of incrementing)
By default clicking a slider location will cause the value of the slider to be set
to the value at the click location, the slider widget thumb will jump to that location.
Deselecting this option will cause the value to change by one increment towards the
mouse click, also moving the widget thumb.

### UI Scale
This option is for Linux only. It must be set to the
same value as your system UI scale or NetLogo will fail to resize its
visual components correctly.
```
Entering an improper value will produce the error message “UI Scale must
be a valid floating point number.”
```

## Code Preferences

### Sort order of procedures menu
Choices:

- Alphabetical (default)
- Order of appearance

### Always show "Included Files" menu
By default the "Included Files" menu is only shown when the Code Tab has an "includes" statement. With this
option the "Included Files" menu will always be in the Code Tab toolbar. That menu allows user to select and open
an included file or choose the **New Source File** or *Open Source File...* options.

### Auto-focus text or tab with errors when model is compiled
If checked, NetLogo will bring you to the location of an error if one
occurs during compilation.

### Open code tab in separate window on startup
When checked the Code tab will appear in a separate window when NetLogo is opened.

### Auto Indent
Auto-focus text or tab with errors when model is compiled

### Show line numbers
When selected line numbers will be shown on the left edge of the Code Tab.

## Logging Preferences

### Enable logging
Create a log file containing user actions. This option can be useful for debugging and research. (restart required)
```
If logging is enabled and a log directory is not specified by the next preference the error message “Logging was enabled, but no log directory was specified.” will appear.
```
### Directory to store logs
Specifies the directory to which log files will be written. You can type in the directory name, or select a
directory using the Browse… dialog. (restart required)

```
If logging is enabled one of the following may happen.

- If you type in a non-existent directory you will see a dialog that
  says “The specified log directory does not exist, would you like to
  create it?” with options “Yes” and “No.”

- You must have write permission for the log directory, otherwise you
  will get the message “NetLogo does not have permission to write to the
  specified log directory.”
```

### Events to log:
Enter a comma-separate list of the event names or “shortcut” names. If you leave this value blank with logging enabled
a set of default events will be logged. For detailed options see the [Events](logging.html#events) of the Logging documentation. The "all" option causes all the events be logged" button, chooser, comment, compile, command-center, global, input-box, link, model-open, slider, speed-slider, start, switch, stop, turtle, widget-edit, and tick
