    <p>
      NetLogo runs on almost any current computer.
    <p>
      If you have any trouble with NetLogo not working, see <a href="contact.html">Contacting Us</a>.
    <h2>
      Application Requirements
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Windows
    </h3>
    <p>
      NetLogo runs on Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Vista, and XP.
    <p>
      The NetLogo installer for Windows installs Java 8 for NetLogo's
      private use only. Other programs on your computer are not affected.
    <h3>
      Mac OS X
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mac OS X 10.7.4 or newer is required. (NetLogo 5.1 was the last version
      to support 10.5 and 10.4; NetLogo 5.2.1 was the last version to support
      10.6)
    <p>
      The NetLogo application contains a distribution of the Java 8 runtime
      for NetLogo's private use only. Other programs on your computer
      will not be affected.
    <h3>
      Other platforms
    </h3>
    <p>
      NetLogo should work on any platform on standard Debian-based
      and Red Hat-based linux distributions. The NetLogo tarball
      includes a copy of the Java 8 runtime.
    <p>
      Start NetLogo by running the provided <code>NetLogo</code>
      executable.
    <h2>
      <a>3D Requirements</a>
    </h2>
    <p id="threed">
      Occasionally an older, less powerful system is not able to use the 3D
      view or NetLogo 3D. Try it and see.
    <p>
      Some systems can use 3D but can't switch to full-screen mode. It
      depends on the graphics card or controller. (For example, the ATI
      Radeon IGP 345 and Intel 82845 probably will not work.)
    <h2>
      <a>32-bit or 64-bit?</a>
    </h2>
    <!-- this needs to be kept in sync with dist/index.html and dist/windows.html -->
    <p id="32-or-64-bit">
      For most users on Linux or Windows, the 32-bit version of
      NetLogo is the simplest way to a working NetLogo installation.
      Advanced users will want to understand the advantages of
      64-bit NetLogo as well as how to determine whether their machine
      meets the requirements.
    <p>
      The primary advantage of the 64-bit version is the ability to add
      additional heap space by changing the "-Xmx" JVM option.
      For more information, see
      <a href="faq.html#howbig">How big can my model be</a>.

    <p>
      To run 64-bit NetLogo, you must be running 64-bit Windows.
      To determine whether your version of Windows is 64-bit, see
      <a target="_blank" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit">Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows</a>
      if you're using Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7, or
      <a target="_blank" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-operating-system">Which Windows operating system am I running?</a>
      if you are running any other version of windows.
    <p>
      For linux users, the easiest way to determine whether your
      operating system is 64-bit is checking the output of <pre>
uname -m
</pre>
      If the output shows "x86_64" or "amd64", you should be able
      to run the 64-bit version.
