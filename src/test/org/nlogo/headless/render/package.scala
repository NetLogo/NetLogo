  * These tests were written before render.TestTurtleDrawer existed.  If you need to test rendering
  * stuff, consider doing it in the render package rather than here, using TestTurtleDrawer or your
  * or own test scaffold that uses similar techniques to keep it all within the render package.
  *
  * However, sometimes it's easier to have the entire workspace available, so you can issue commands
  * and test that the right things were rendered. If you need that, it's easier here.
