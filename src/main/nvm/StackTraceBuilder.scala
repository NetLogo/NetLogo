/**
 * A stack trace is displayed to the user when an error occurs in running code.
 * Example:
 *
 * division by zero
 * error while observer running /
 *   called by plot 'plot 1' setup code
 *   called by RESET-TICKS
 *   called by procedure SETUP
 *   called by Command Center
 *
 * Entries in stack traces can come from different places.
 *
 * In the example,
 * - "/" is the individual primitive in which the error occurred
 * - "plot 'plot 1' setup code" is an anonymous procedure in a plot
 * - "RESET-TICKS" is not a procedure, but a command that can trigger
 *   the execution of procedures (see also tick, setup-plots, update-plots)
 * - "SETUP" is an ordinary procedure
 * - "Command Center" is the display name of the dummy top level procedure
 *   wrapped around the user's code.
