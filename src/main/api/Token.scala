// What kind of object is stored in the value slot is will vary depending on the token type.  If the
// type is COMMAND or REPORTER, a Command or Reporter object will be stored.  If the type is
// Literal, the value of the literal is stored (a String or Integer or Double or LogoList or
// whatever).  And so on.  For some tokens, it will be null, for example for OpenBrace and so on.

// There are two argument lists because we won't need to pattern match on the position or filename;
// they're auxiliary information.  Also we don't want them in the toString output either since it
// makes test cases annoying to write.
