/**
 * This is used by SliderConstraint.  Sliders have snippets of Logo code associated with them, which
 * need be to be evaluated to produce numbers for the min, max, and increment.  But here in the
 * org.nlogo.agent package we don't know anything about Logo code and how to run it.  This interface
 * lets other code keep us in the dark by giving us a black box that magically produces an object
 * whenever we ask for one.  (In the case of SliderConstraint the object should be a boxed double.)
