A note on integer math vs. floating point math.

At one time, NetLogo was written in Java 1.1, which didn't have Java2D.
In Java 1.1, everything you did with graphics was with integers.

In Java2D, on the other hand, you can pass doubles instead of ints for
the locations and sizes of things, and Java2D will use anti-aliasing
to make those fractional parts actually have visible effects.

Over time, we have been moving towards using doubles for everything.
I think (I hope) that doubles are now used in all the most important
places.  But there is still some pointless rounding from doubles to
ints that takes place in various places below, for example for things
like the location of the spotlight and the location of labels.
There's no good reason not to fix this, it just hasn't been done yet.
Rounding to ints should never mean that we're off by more than half a
pixel, though, and on things like the halo and labels it seems
unlikely that anyone would ever notice.

If you're wondering if anyone would ever notice if *anything* was half
a pixel off, the answer is definitely yes.  Being half a pixel off can
create easily noticeable artifacts when you are drawing very small
objects, and/or when you are drawing grids of objects, where the grid
structure can make misalignment or inconsistent alignment really jump
out at you visually.  And of course, grids of small objects are very
common in NetLogo models.

So, two conclusions:

  - don't be surprised if you see some occasional carelessness around
    the issue in this code

  - but, more importantly, *DON'T* be careless about it yourself.  In
    the most important parts of the code, for example the sizing and
    positioning of turtles, the code is now very careful to do it
    right.  (I hope I got it right!)  So don't break it.  And whenever
    you are modifying or adding anything, please be very conscientious
    about getting the calculations exactly right.  Let's only move
    towards perfection... never away.
