Holds the `AbstractWorkspace` class and related classes -- `AbstractWorkspace` implements the `Workspace` interface from the `nvm` package -- `Workspace` is supposed to represent a model that is open -- currently we can only have one open at a time so there's only one `Workspace` object, but eventually we plan to support multiple open models. `GUIWorkspace` (in the `window` package) and `HeadlessWorkspace` (in the `headless` package) both subclass `AbstractWorkspace`. `Workspace` has methods for retrieving many of the objects associated with a model, so it's kind of a central point for getting references to objects.
