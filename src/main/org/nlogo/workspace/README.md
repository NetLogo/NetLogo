holds the AbstractWorkspace class and related classes -- AbstractWorkspace implements the Workspace interface from the nvm package -- Workspace is supposed to represent a model that is open -- currently we can only have one open at a time so there's only one Workspace object, but eventually we plan to support multiple open models. GUIWorkspace (in the window package) and HeadlessWorkspace (in the headless package) both subclass AbstractWorkspace. Workspace has methods for retrieving many of the objects associated with a model, so it's kind of a central point for getting references to objects.
