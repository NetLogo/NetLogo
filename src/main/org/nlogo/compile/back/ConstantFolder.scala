// Performs constant folding (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding)

// What if a runtime error occurs when we try to fold?  Currently, we report it to the user at
// compile-time.  But we could wait until runtime to deal with it.  Perhaps users will find it
// disconcerting that some of their code is being "run" at compile-time, and errors pop up.  Waiting
// evaluation would also allow us to compile division by zero, etc.  The problem with waiting is
// that right now the bytecode generator doesn't gracefully handle bad inputs.  Since impossible
// things like "5 - true" can make the bytecode generator choke, for now it's better to catch these
// errors here, rather than hand them on to the bytecode generator, where bad things will happen.
// ~Forrest (10/13/2006)

// I think compile time reporting is definitely good. - ST 2/12/09

// One might expect this to be part of the middle end rather than the back end.  But
// it needs to actually execute code in order to do its job, and for that it uses
// ArgumentStuffer, which is definitely back end stuff. - ST 8/27/13
