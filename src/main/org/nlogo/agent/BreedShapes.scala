// methods need to be synchronized so since they can run on both the JobManager thread and the event
// thread without corrupting the shapes map.  we are safe from deadlock here since the methods are
// self-contained. we don't want to synchronize on the world since other classes do that and this
// really shouldn't affect their performance.  so we use a lock object.  --mag 10/03/03
