  // On the conversion of VALUE-FROM, VALUES-FROM, HISTOGRAM-FROM:
  //
  // These are especially hard, harder than all the other auto-
  // conversions we've done in the past, in that it requires actual parsing,
  // not just tokenization.  To convert e.g.:
  //   value-from foo [bar]  =>  [bar] of foo
  // It's not enough to tokenize the code, because we need to figure out which
  // pair of brackets corresponds to which VALUE-FROM, and this is a difficult
  // problem in general; consider for example:
  //   values-from turtles with [foo] [bar] => [bar] of turtles with [foo]
  // In order to pair values-from with bar instead of foo, we need
  // to know the syntax of WITH.  We need to parse. - ST 7/1/06
  //
  // We have a chicken and egg problem during model loading.  First
  // we load the procedures, then we load the widgets.  Both need to
  // be autoconverted.  But it's not straightforwardly possible to
  // compile them because they can refer to each other.  In the
  // ordinary loading code, the cycle is broken by delaying
  // compilation of the Code tab until LoadEndEvent time.  But
  // now that AutoConverter invokes the parser, we need a smarter
  // solution, because we can't parse the code in the widgets
  // without the information in the Program object (put there when
  // StructureParser runs on the contents of the Code tab).
  // So here's what we do.  At the time the procedures section
  // loads, convertValueAndValuesFrom invokes IdentifierParser in
  // "forgiving" mode, which means that any unknown identifier in
  // the procedures must refer to an interface global we haven't
  // seen yet.  This is enough to partially fill the Program object
  // with information, enough information to make it possible to
  // parse the code in the widgets.  Finally, at LoadEndEvent time,
  // that partial Program object is discarded and replaced with a
  // full one when CompileManager does a full recompile of
  // everything. - ST 7/7/06
  //
  // A further wrinkle is the when we were only tokenizing, we
  // couldn't recover from tokenization failures during
  // autoconversion, which technically was a bug, but in practice we
  // didn't consider it a problem because it's very rare for someone
  // to have a saved model that doesn't even tokenize, and equally
  // rare for us to change the rules of what tokenizes and what
  // doesn't.  But it's far more common for us to change in the
  // language in ways that cause code not to parse; for example for
  // NetLogo 4.0 we are eliminating random-int-or-float and making
  // the + operator no longer work on strings and lists, only
  // numbers. So it's pretty essential that auto-conversion be able
  // to recover even when a parsing failure occurs.

   * These are the auto-conversions that require parsing (not just tokenization).
   *
   * 1) Finds occurrences of _valuefrom and changes them to _of.  Actually instead of making the
   * changes directly, we add Replacement objects to a list; the replacements will all be made at
   * once later.
   * Example: values-from turtles [color]
   * becomes: [color] of turtles
   * through two replacements:
   *   new Replacement(..., "values-from", "[color] of")
   *   new Replacement(..., " [color]", "")

   * The reason we do it in two replacements instead of one is to avoid damage to whitespace and/or
   * comments that may be interspersed in the code we are altering.  (We remove at most one space
   * before the left bracket.)
   *
   * 2) Convert _histogramfrom to _histogram + _of.
   *
   * 3) Attempt to convert random-or-random-float to either
   * random or random-float if we can deduce which is correct.
