// here is the AstNode (AST = Abstract Syntax Tree) trait, along with its extending traits
// Expression and Application and their subclasses: ProcedureDefinition, Statements, Statement,
// ReporterApp, ReporterBlock, CommandBlock, DelayedBlock.

/*
 * The jargon here is a bit different from the usual NetLogo terminology:
 *  - "command" is an actual command token itself, e.g., show, run.
 *  - "reporter" is an actual reporter itself, e.g., +, round, with.
 *  - "statement" is a syntactic form with no value and a command as head (e.g., show 5)
 *  - "expression" is a syntactic form which can occur as an argument to a command or to a
 *    reporter. expressions denote values. there are two basic kinds of expression:
 *     - reporter applications (infix or prefix). Note that this is reporter in the internal
 *       sense, which includes variables and literals. So these include, e.g.,
 *       turtles with [ true ], 5 + 10, 5, [1 2 3].
 *     - blocks. command and reporter blocks are expressions of this type.
 *       A command block contains zero or more statements, while a reporter
 *       block contains exactly one expression.
