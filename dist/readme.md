# NetLogo {{version}}

{{date}}

## Release notes

See our [online release notes](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Release-notes).

## Upgrading

Most models created in earlier versions of NetLogo will work in
this release with only minor updates to the code.  If you have
trouble, please consult our
[Transition Guide](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/transition.html).

## Community

Our [resources page](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/resources.shtml)
contains links to NetLogo mailing lists, places to get help, books,
add-ons, and more.

## How to run

### Windows

Choose NetLogo from the Start menu.

### Mac

Double click on the NetLogo icon in the NetLogo folder.  (You may wish
to drag this icon to the dock for easy access.)

### Linux et al

You may be able to just double-click `NetLogo` in your file manager.
Or, from the command line, typical Unix shell commands would be:

    $ cd netlogo-{{version}}-*
    $ ./NetLogo

## Citing

If you use or refer to NetLogo in a publication, we ask that you cite
it.  The correct citation is:

> Wilensky, U. (1999). NetLogo. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo.
> Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling,
> Northwestern University, Evanston, IL.

For HubNet, cite:

> Wilensky, U. & Stroup, W., 1999. HubNet.
> http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/hubnet.html. Center
> for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern
> University. Evanston, IL.

For models in the Models Library, the correct citation is included in
the "Credits and References" section of each model's Info tab.
