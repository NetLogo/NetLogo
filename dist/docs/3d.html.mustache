      NetLogo includes the NetLogo 3D application that allows you to create 3D worlds.
    <p>
      <b>Notice:</b> NetLogo's support for 3D is less developed than
      NetLogo 2D. Models created with this release may not be compatible
      with future versions. While we've made efforts to ensure a quality
      product, NetLogo 3D has not been subject to the same level of quality
      control as the main application.

    <p>
      NetLogo 3D's world has width, height and depth. Patches are
      cubes. In addition to <code><a href="dictionary.html#pcor">pxcor</a></code> and <code><a href="dictionary.html#pcor">pycor</a></code>, patches have <code><a href="#pzcor">pzcor</a></code>.
    <p>
      Turtles have three Cartesian coordinates, instead of two, to describe
      position. In addition to <code><a href="dictionary.html#xcor">xcor</a></code> and <code><a href="dictionary.html#ycor">ycor</a></code>, turtles have <code><a href="#zcor">zcor</a></code>.
    <p>
      A turtle's orientation is defined by three turtle variables,
      <code><a href="dictionary.html#heading">heading</a></code>, <code><a href="#pitch">pitch</a></code> and <code><a href="#roll">roll</a></code>. You
      can imagine the turtle as having two vectors to define its
      orientation in 3D space. One vector comes straight out of the nose of
      the turtle, this is the direction the turtle will travel when it
      moves forward. The second vector is perpendicular to the forward
      vector and comes out of the right side of the turtle (as if the
      turtle were to stick its right arm straight out from its body).
      Heading is the angle between the forward vector of the turtle
      projected onto the xy-plane and the vector [0 1 0]. Pitch is the
      angle between the forward vector of the turtle and the xy-plane and
      finally roll is the angle between the right vector of the turtle and
      the xy-plane. When turtle turns right or left in 3D space it rotates
      around the down vector, that is the vector that is perpendicular to
      both the forward and right vectors. Depending on the orientation of
      the turtle more than one of the internal turtle variables may change
      as the result of a turn.
    <h4>
      <span class="prim_example">The observer and the 3D view</span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      The point of view that you see the world from is considered the
      location and orientation of the observer. This is similar to the 3D
      view in NetLogo 2D. However, there are a few more ways to control the
      observer. You can set the point that the observer is facing by using
      <code>face</code> and <code>facexyz</code> which work the same way as the
      turtle commands, the observer turns so the center of the view is on
      the given point or the location of the given agent at the time it is
      called. You can change the location of the observer using
      <code>setxyz</code>. The observer will move to view the world as if
      standing on the given location, the point the observer faces will
      stay the same. For example create a new model and observer will be
      located at (0, 0, 49.5), that is, on the z-axis 49.5 patch units away
      from the origin and the observer is facing the origin, (0, 0, 0). If
      you <code>setxyz 0 49.5 0</code> the observer will move so it is on the
      positive y-axis but it will keep the origin at the center of the
      view. You can also move the observer using the rotation primitives
      that will allow you to move the observer around the world as if on
      the surface of a sphere where the center is the location the observer
      is facing. You may notice from the above examples that the observer
      is not constrained to be within the bounds of the world.
    <h4>
      <span class="prim_example"><a id="custom-shapes">Custom Shapes</a></span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      NetLogo automatically interprets 2D shapes so they are extruded, like
      a cookie cutter shape in the 3D view. You can also use the primitive
      <a href="#load-shapes-3d"><code>load-shapes-3d</code></a> to load shapes
      described in an external file in a custom format described here.
      Currently we do not import shapes in any standard formats.
    <p>
      For each shape in a custom 3D shape file, a 2D shape of the same name
      must exist as well. You can create the 2D shape in the Turtle Shapes
      Editor.
    <p>
      The input file may contain any number of shapes with any number of
      rectangular or triangular surfaces. The format of the input file
      should be as follows:
    <pre>
number of shapes in file
name of first shape
type of surface ( quads or tris )
surface1
surface2
.
.
.
stop
type of surface
surfaceA
.
.
.
stop
end-shape
</pre>
    <p>
      Each surface is defined by a unit normal vector and the vertices
      listed in clockwise order, tris should have three vertices and quads
      should have four.
    <pre>
normal: xn yn zn
x1 y1 z1
x2 y2 z2
x3 y3 z3
x4 y4 z4
</pre>
    <p>
      A file declaring just a two dimensional, patch-sized, square in the
      xy-plane centered at the origin would look like this:
    <pre>
1
square
quads
normal: 0 0 1
0.15 0.15 0
-0.15 0.15 0
-0.15 -0.15 0
0.15 -0.15 0
normal: 0 0 -1
0.15 0.15 0
0.15 -0.15 0

      One of the first things you will notice when you open NetLogo 3D is
      that the world is a cube instead of a square.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/threed/cube.gif">
    <p>
      You can open up the Model Settings, by clicking on the
      &quot;Settings...&quot; button at the top of the 3D View. You'll
      notice in addition to <code>max-pxcor</code>, <code>min-pxcor</code>,
      <code>max-pycor</code>, and <code>min-pycor</code>, there is also <a href="#min-max-pzcor"><code>max-pzcor</code></a> and <a href="#min-max-pzcor"><code>min-pzcor</code></a>.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/threed/properties.png">
    <p>
      The z-axis is perpendicular to both the x-axis and the y-axis, when
      you <code>reset-perspective</code> it is the axis that comes straight out
      of the screen. In the default position <code>max-pzcor</code> is the face
      of the cube nearest to you and <code>min-pzcor</code> is the face
      farthest from you. As always <code>min-pxcor</code> is on the left,
      <code>max-pxcor</code> on the right, <code>min-pycor</code> on the bottom,
      and <code>max-pycor</code> on the top.
    <p>
      You'll also notice on the left side of the Model Settings that
      there are options for wrapping in all three directions, however, they
      are all checked and grayed out. Topologies are not yet supported in
      NetLogo 3D, so the world always wraps in all dimensions.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Move to the Command Center and type <code>print count
        patches</code>.
        </ul>
      <p class="question">
        Is the number smaller or larger than you expected?
      </div>
    <p>
      In a 3D world the number of patches grows very quickly since
      <code>count patches = world-width * world-height * world-depth</code>.
      It's important to keep this in mind when you are building your
      model. Lots of patches can slow your model down or even cause NetLogo
      to run out of memory.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Type <code>ask patch 1 2 3 [ set pcolor red ]</code> into the
        Command Center.
        <li>Use the mouse in the 3D view to rotate the world.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Notice the shape of the patch and its position in relation to the
      edges of the world. You'll also notice that you now need three
      coordinates to address patches in a 3D world.

      Take a moment to look for the controls and monitors. In the bottom
      left you'll notice a group of monitors that describe the location
      and orientation of the turtle, though until you press the setup
      button they'll all say &quot;N/A&quot;.
    <div class="blockquote">

    <p>
      Heading, pitch, and roll are turtle variables that represent the
      orientation of the turtle. Heading is absolute in relation to the x/y
      plane; it is the rotation of the turtle around the z-axis.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/threed/heading.gif">
    <p>
      Pitch is the angle between the nose of the turtle and the xy-plane.
      It is relative to heading.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/threed/pitch.gif">
    <p>
      Roll is the rotation around the turtle's forward vector. It is
      relative to heading and pitch.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/threed/roll.gif">
    <p>
      When turtles are created with <code>create-turtles</code> or
      <code>create-ordered-turtles</code>, their initial headings vary but
      their initial pitch and roll are always zero.

        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      You probably noticed that often more than one of the turtle variables
      may change for a single turn. For this reason we suggest that you use
      the turtle commands rather than setting the orientation variables
      directly.
    <h4>
      <span class="prim_example">Step 3: Observer Movement</span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      At the bottom of the interface you will see Orbit, Zoom, and Move
      buttons. If you have ever used the 3D view in NetLogo 2D or if you
      have been using the mouse controls in the 3D view through this
      tutorial you have been moving the observer. Changing the point of
      view in the 3D view is actually moving and changing the orientation
      of the observer. The observer has x, y and z coordinates, just like a
      turtle or patch, while turtles and patches are constrained to be
      inside the world the observer can be anywhere. Like a turtle the
      observer has a heading, pitch and roll, these variables control where
      the observer is looking, that is, what you see in the view.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Move to the 3D view, and make sure &quot;Orbit&quot; is
        selected in the bottom left corner of the view.
        <li>Click and hold the mouse button in the middle of the view, move
        the mouse left, right, up, and down.
        </ul>
      <p class="question">
        How does the position and orientation of the observer change?
      <ul>
        <li>Press the reset-perspective button in the lower right corner of
        the view and select &quot;Zoom&quot; in the lower left corner.
        <li>Click and hold the mouse button in the middle of the view and
        move the mouse up and down.
        </ul>
      <p class="question">
        Which of the observer variables change? Which stay the same?
      <ul>
        <li>Try rotating the world a bit and then zoom again.
        <li>Press the &quot;Move&quot; button in the lower left corner of
        the view.
        <li>Click and hold the mouse button in the middle of the view and
        move the mouse up, down, left and right.
        </ul>
      <p class="question">
        How does the view change? How do the observer variables change?
      </div>
    <p>
      After you are done exploring the world using the mouse controls you
      can take a look at the observer control buttons in the lower left
      portion of the interface.
    <p>
      You may already be familiar with the first three buttons in the
      observer group from your experience with NetLogo 2D. Watch, follow,
      and ride, are special modes that automatically update the position
      and orientation of the observer. When in follow or ride mode, the
      observer position and orientation are the same as the turtle's.
      Note that follow and ride are functionally exactly the same, the
      difference is only visual in the 3D view. When in watch mode the
      observer does not move but updates to face the target agent.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Press the &quot;setup&quot; button again so you are back to the
        default orientation.
        <li>Press the &quot;orbit-right&quot; button.
        </ul>
      <p class="question">
        How did the view change? Was it what you expected? How is it
        similar or different from using the mouse controls?
      <ul>
        <li>Take a little time to experiment with orbit, roll and zoom
        buttons; notice similarities and differences to the mouse controls.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      The direction of the orbit commands refer to the direction that the
      observer moves. That is, imagine that the observer is on the surface
      of a sphere, the center of the sphere is the point that the observer
      is facing represented by the blue cross, by default (0,0,0). The
      observer will always face the center of the sphere and the radius of
      the sphere will remain constant. The directions, up, down, left, and
      right, refer to moving along the lines of latitude and the lines of
      longitude of the sphere. When you zoom the radius of the sphere
      changes but the center and the observer's orientation in relation
      to the center of the sphere will remain the same.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Press one of the &quot;setxyz&quot; buttons.
        </ul>
      <p class="question">
        How does the view change? How do the observer variables change?
      <ul>
        <li>Press the &quot;facexyz&quot; button.
        </ul>
      <p class="question">
        How does the view change? How do the observer variables change?
      </div>
    <p>
      When you <code>setxyz</code> the center of the sphere remains the same
      (so the observer automatically keeps that point in the center of the
      view.) However, the radius of the sphere may change as well as the
      observer's orientation in relation to the center. When you
      <code>facexyz</code> or <code>face</code>, the center of the sphere changes
      but the observer does not move. The radius of the sphere may change,
      as well as the orientation of the observer.

        This is a built-in turtle variable. Pitch is the angle between the
        &quot;nose&quot; of the turtle and the xy-plane. Heading and pitch
        together define the forward vector of the turtle or the direction
        that the turtle is facing.
      <p>
        This is a number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 360. 0 is
        parallel to the xy-plane, 90 is parallel to the z-axis. While you
        can set pitch we recommend that you use the primitives to turn the
        turtle. Depending on the position more than one relative angle
        (heading, pitch and roll) may change at once.
      <p>
        Example:
      <pre>
;; assume roll and heading are 0
set pitch 45      ;; turtle is now north and up
set heading heading + 10 ;; same effect as &quot;tilt-up 10&quot;

        The nose of the turtle rotates by <i>number</i> degrees, relative

        turtle more than one of the relative angles (heading, pitch, and
        roll) may change when a turtle turns.

        If the wrapped distance (around the edges of the screen) is shorter
        than the on-screen distance, towards-pitch will report the pitch of
        the wrapped path. towards-pitch-nowrap never uses the wrapped path.
      <p>
        Note: In order to get one turtle to face another you need to use
        both towards-pitch and towards.
      <p>
        Note: asking for the pitch from an agent to itself, or an agent on
        the same location, will cause a runtime error.

        This is a built-in turtle variable. It holds the current z
        coordinate of the turtle. This is a floating point number, not an
        integer. You can set this variable to change the turtle's
        location.
      <p>
        This variable is always greater than or equal to (- screen-edge-z)
        and strictly less than screen-edge-z.
