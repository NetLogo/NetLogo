      General
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Why is it called NetLogo?
    </h3>
    <p id="name">
      The &quot;Logo&quot; part is because NetLogo is a dialect of the Logo
      language.
    <p>
      &quot;Net&quot; is meant to evoke the decentralized, interconnected
      nature of the phenomena you can model with NetLogo, including network
      phenomena. It also refers to HubNet, the multiuser participatory
      simulation environment included in NetLogo.
    <h3>
      How do I cite NetLogo or HubNet in a publication?
    </h3>
    <p id="cite">
      If you use or refer to NetLogo, HubNet or a model from the NetLogo
      models library, we ask that you cite it as follows:
    <p>

    <h3>
      How do I cite a model from the
      Models Library in a publication?
    </h3>
    <p id="citemodel">
      The correct citation is included in the &quot;Credits and
      References&quot; section of each model's Info tab.
    <h3>
      Where and when was NetLogo created?
    </h3>
    <p id="history">
      NetLogo was first created in 1999 by Uri Wilensky at the Center for
      Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling, then at Tufts
      University in the Boston area. NetLogo grew out of StarLogoT, which
      was authored by Wilensky in 1997. In 2000, the CCL moved to
      Northwestern University, in the Chicago area. NetLogo 1.0 came out in
      2002, 2.0 in 2003, 3.0 in 2005, 4.0 in 2007, 4.1 in 2009, and 5.0 in
      2012.
    <h3>
      What programming language was
      NetLogo written in?
    </h3>
    <p id="written">
      NetLogo is written mostly in Scala, with some parts in Java. (Scala
      code compiles to Java byte code and is fully interoperable with Java
      and other JVM languages.)
    <h3>
      What's the relationship
      between StarLogo and NetLogo?
    </h3>
    <p id="starlogo">
      The original StarLogo began at the MIT Media Lab in 1989 and ran on
      the Connection Machine. Later versions were developed for Macintosh
      computers: MacStarLogo (1994, MIT) and StarLogoT (1997, Tufts).
    <p>
      Today there are two StarLogo descendants under active development:
      NetLogo (from the CCL at Northwestern University) and StarLogo TNG
      (from MIT). NetLogo is the most widely used agent-based modeling
      environment in both education and research. StarLogo TNG is
      distinguished by its programming interface based on colored blocks.

    <h3>
      Do you offer any workshops or
      other training opportunities for NetLogo?
    </h3>
    <p id="workshop">
      We offer workshops from time to time. If a workshop has been
      scheduled, we will announce it on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/netlogo-users/">NetLogo Users
      Group</a>.
    <h3>
      Are there any NetLogo textbooks?
    </h3>
    <p id="books">
      The CCL has published a textbook (written by the author of NetLogo)
      that gives an introduction to agent-based modeling methods using NetLogo.
      It goes step by step with coding examples how to design, build, revise,
      and analyze models. And it presents some advanced techniques.
    <p>
      See <a href="http://www.intro-to-abm.com">www.intro-to-abm.com</a> for more
      information on that textbook.
    <p>
      See the Textbooks section of our <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/resources.shtml">Resources</a>
      page.
    <p>
      We at the CCL have hoped to write several more NetLogo textbooks.
      These could be aimed at different audiences, such as: middle school,
      high school, undergraduate course in modeling or complexity, practical
      guide for interested adults.
    <p>
      Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to find the time to make these
      happen. If anyone from the user community would like to collaborate on
      such a venture, please let us know. We would welcome it.
    <h3>
      Is NetLogo available in
      other languages besides English?
    </h3>
    <p id="translation">
      Volunteers have translated the user manual into Chinese and Czech.
      The translated versions are available from the NetLogo web site.
    <p>
      So far, the NetLogo user interface has been localized in English,
      Spanish, Chinese, and Russian. All four languages are included in the
      standard download.
    <p>
      We are seeking volunteers to complete and improve these localizations
      and to translate the NetLogo software and manual into as many other
      languages as possible. If you're able to help in this endeavor,
      please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.
    <h3>
      Is NetLogo compiled or interpreted?
    </h3>
    <p id="compilation">
      Short answer: some of both.
    <p>
      Long answer: NetLogo does include a compiler that generates Java byte
      code. However, this compiler does not yet support the entire
      language, so some parts of user code remain interpreted. Note that
      our compiler generates Java byte code, and Java virtual machines have
      &quot;just-in-time&quot; compilers that in turn compile Java byte
      code all the way to native code, so much user code is ultimately
      translated to native code.
    <h3>
      Has anyone built a model of &lt;x&gt;?
    </h3>
    <p id="model">
      Try looking at the <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/">NetLogo Models
      Library</a>, the <a href="http://modelingcommons.org/">NetLogo
      Modeling Commons</a>, our <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/">Community
      Models</a> page, and our <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/references.shtml">list of
      references to NetLogo in outside works</a>.

      You might also ask the question on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/netlogo-users/">NetLogo Users
      Group</a> and/or search past messages on the group.
    <h3>
      Are NetLogo models runs
      scientifically reproducible?
    </h3>
    <p id="reproduce">
      Yes. NetLogo's pseudorandom number generator and agent scheduling
      algorithms are deterministic, and NetLogo always uses Java's
      &quot;strict math&quot; library, which gives bit-for-bit identical
      results regardless of platform. But keep the following cautions in
      mind:
    <ul>
      <li>If your model uses random numbers, then in order to get
      reproducible behavior, you must use the <code>random-seed</code> command
      to set the random seed in advance, so that your model will receive
      the exact same sequence of random numbers every time. Remember that
      agentsets are always in random order, so anything you do with
      agentsets uses random numbers.
      <li>If your model uses the <code>every</code> or <code>wait</code> commands
      in such a way that affects the outcome of the model, then you may get
      different results on different computers, or even on the same
      computer, since the model may run at a different speed.
      <li>In order to reproduce model runs exactly, you must be using the
      exact same version of NetLogo. The details of the agent scheduling
      mechanism and the random number generator may change between NetLogo
      versions, and other changes (bugfixes in the engine, language
      changes, and so forth) may also affect the behavior of your model.
      (Then again, they may not.)
      <li>We have expended every effort to make NetLogo model runs fully
      reproducible, but of course this can never truly be an iron-clad
      guarantee, due not only to the possibility of random hardware
      failure, but also the possibility of human error in the design of:
      your model, NetLogo, your Java VM, your hardware, and so on.
      </ul>
    <h3>
      Will NetLogo and NetLogo 3D remain separate?
    </h3>
    <p id="threedsplit">
      For now, yes. NetLogo 3D is included with NetLogo, but it is still a
      separate application.
    <p>
      Ideally a single unified application would support both 2D and 3D
      modeling. We would design the 3D world support so it doesn't get
      in the way when you are building 2D models. Models built in NetLogo
      3D might require changes in order to run in the hypothetical unified
      application.
    <h3>
      Can I run NetLogo on my phone or
      tablet?
    </h3>
    <p id="mobile">
      No. Neither iOS, nor Android, nor Windows RT supports running Java
      applications such as NetLogo.
    <p>
      We are working on an alternate implementation of NetLogo on a
      JavaScript and HTML5 base, instead of Java. It will work on a variety
      of tablets and phones. We don't know yet when it will be ready,
      and we expect that for a long time it will only support a subset of
      the features in desktop NetLogo. The many person-years of development
      effort that have gone into the Java version can't cheaply or
      easily be replicated on another platform.

    <h2>
      Downloading
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Can I have multiple
      versions of NetLogo installed at the same time?
    </h3>
    <p id="multiversions">
      Yes. When you install NetLogo, the folder that is created contains
      has the version number in its name, so multiple versions can coexist.
    <p>
      On Windows systems, whichever version you installed last will be the
      version that opens when you double click a model file in Windows
      Explorer. On Macs, you can control what version opens via &quot;Get
      Info&quot; in the Finder.

    <p id="gnutar">
      Some of the files in the tarball have long pathnames, too long for
      the standard tar format. You must use the GNU version of tar instead
      (or another program which understands the GNU tar extensions). On
      some systems, the GNU version of tar is available under the name
      &quot;gnutar&quot;. You can find out if you are already using the GNU
      version by typing <code>tar --version</code> and seeing if the output
      says &quot;tar (GNU tar)&quot;.

      Can I run NetLogo from a CD, a network
      drive, or a USB drive?
    </h3>
    <p id="runcd">
      Yes. NetLogo runs fine from any file system, including read-only file
      systems.
    <h3>
      Why is NetLogo so much
      slower when I unplug my Windows laptop?
    </h3>
    <p id="slowlaptop">
      Your computer is switching to power saving mode when unplugged.
      It's normal for this to reduce speed a little, but unfortunately
      there is a bug in Java that drastically slows down Swing
      applications, including NetLogo.
    <p>
      One workaround is to change the power settings on your computer so it
      doesn't go into power saving mode when you unplug it. (If you do
      this, your battery won't last as long.)
    <p>
      Another workaround is to run NetLogo with an option recommended by
      Oracle, by editing the NetLogo {{version}}.vmoptions file, found in
      the NetLogo directory (under Program Files on your hard drive, unless
      you installed NetLogo in a different location). Add on a new line:
    <pre>
-Dsun.java2d.ddoffscreen=false

    <h3>
        Why does NetLogo bundle Java?
    </h3>
    <p>
      For backwards compatibility, NetLogo 5.0.0-5.2.1 required that Java 6
      from Apple be installed. As OS X continued to update, java 6 was removed
      from the default distribution and available for download from Apple,
      adding to the complexity of installing NetLogo.
    <p>
      The decision was made to bundle Java 8 with 5.3, reducing installation
      complexity and hopefully promoting stability. To minimize any disruption,
      the upgrade NetLogo 5.3 avoided any changes not directly related to
      bundling java 8.  If you're running 5.2.1 happily on Java 6, or stuck
      on a version of OS X older than 10.7.4, there are <b>no</b>
      features that you need to upgrade in order to get.
    </div>
    <h3>
      How come NetLogo won't
      start up on my Linux machine?
    </h3>
    <p id="linuxcompat">
      We bundle Oracle's Java runtime when using NetLogo on Linux.
      If you would like to change the version of linux used, you can modify
      the .cfg files to point to a different version of java (see
      <a href="#howbig">How big can my model be?</a> for more information).
    <p>
      In theory, any Java 6 or later runtime will run NetLogo. In practice,
      some Java implementations aren't high enough quality. Recent
      versions of OpenJDK should work; older ones may not. GNU libgcj does
      not work.
    <p>
      Ubuntu users should consult <a href="http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java">http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java</a>.

    <p id="windowsmemory">
    A nearly certain fix is to use a text editor to edit the
    NetLogo.cfg file, changing 1024m to a smaller number, like 512m.
    This should permit NetLogo to start, although the lower heap
    size limit may affect your ability to run models with many agents.
    See <a href="#howbig">How big can my model be?</a> for
    information on model size and how to edit the cfg file.
    <p>
      If running with the lower heap size limit is unacceptable, read on.
    <p>
      Some Windows systems have trouble allocating large amounts of
      contiguous virtual memory. Upgrading to a newer version of Windows
      may help.
    <p>
      Running Windows in 64-bit mode instead of 32-bit mode may also help.
      Double check that Windows is actually running in 64-bit mode; see

    <h3>
      Can I run NetLogo from the command
      line, without the GUI?
    </h3>
    <p id="batch">
      Yes. The easiest way is to set up your model run or runs as a
      BehaviorSpace experiment. No additional programming is required. See
      the <a href="behaviorspace.html">BehaviorSpace Guide</a> for details.
    <p>
      Another option is to use our Controlling API. Some light Java
      programming is required. See the <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Controlling-API">Controlling
      API Guide</a> for details and sample code.
    <h3>
      Does NetLogo take
      advantage of multiple processors?
    </h3>
    <p id="multiprocessing">
      Only when using BehaviorSpace. BehaviorSpace does parallel runs, one
      per processor.
    <p>
      For a single model run, only one processor is used.
    <p>
      We are seeking funding to make it possible to split a single model
      run across multiple processors or multiple computers.
    <h3>
      Can I distribute NetLogo model
      runs across a cluster or grid of computers?
    </h3>
    <p id="cluster">
      Many of the same comments in the previous answer apply. It is not
      possible to split a single model run across multiple computers, but
      you can have each machine in a cluster doing one or more separate,
      independent model runs, using either BehaviorSpace or our Controlling
      API. We don't have automated support for splitting the runs
      across clusters, so you'll need to arrange that yourself.
    <p>
      Various users are already using NetLogo on clusters, with a variety
      of hardware and software. You can seek them out on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/netlogo-users/">NetLogo Users
      Group</a>.
    <h3>
      Is there any way to recover lost
      work if NetLogo crashes or freezes?
    </h3>
    <p id="autosave">
      Yes. NetLogo auto-saves files as you are working on them. The
      auto-save files can be found in your OS-specific temporary directory.
      On most Unix-like systems (including MacOS) that is <code>/tmp</code>. On
      Windows XP, logs can be found in <code>C:\Documents and
      Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Local Settings\Temp</code>, where
      <code>&lt;user&gt;</code> is the logged in user and on Windows Vista the
      logs can be found in
      <code>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp</code>. The files are
      named according to the following format:
      <code>autosave_yyyy-MM-dd.HH_mm_ss.nlogo</code> where the time and date
      are the time and date the model was opened.

    <h3>
      When I move the speed
      slider all the way to the right, why does my model seem to stop?
    </h3>
    <p id="fastseemsslow">
      The only way NetLogo can make your model run faster is by updating
      the view less frequently. As you move the speed slider to the right,
      view updates become less and less frequent. Since view updates take
      time, that means more speed.
    <p>
      However, fewer updates also means that the updates come farther
      apart. When several seconds pass between updates, it may seem like
      your model has stopped. It hasn't. It's running at full
      speed. Watch the tick counter! (If your model uses it. If it
      doesn't, watch something else, like a plot.)
    <p>
      To get a feel for what's going on, try moving the slider to the
      right gradually rather than suddenly. If you find the updates too
      infrequent at the rightmost position, just don't push the slider
      that far.
    <h3>
      Can I use the mouse to
      &quot;paint&quot; in the view?
    </h3>
    <p id="paint">
      NetLogo does not have a built-in set of painting tools for painting
      in the view. But with only a few lines of code, you can add painting
      capability to your model. To see how it's done, look at Mouse
      Example, in the Code Examples section of the Models Library. The same
      techniques can be used to let the user interact with your model using
      the mouse in other ways, too.
    <p>
      Another possibility is to create an image in another program and
      import it using the import items on the File menu or the
      <code>import-*</code> primitives.
    <h3>
      How big can my model be? How many turtles, patches, procedures, buttons,
      and so on can my model contain?
    </h3>
    <p id="howbig">
      We have tested NetLogo with models that use hundreds of megabytes of
      RAM and they work fine. We haven't tested models that use
      gigabytes of RAM, though. Theoretically it should work, but you might
      hit some limits that are inherent in the underlying Java VM and/or
      operating system (either designed-in limits, or bugs).
    <p>
      The NetLogo engine has no fixed limits on size. By default, though,
      NetLogo ships with a one-gigabyte ceiling on how much total RAM it can
      use. If your model exceeds that limit, you'll get an OutOfMemoryError
      dialog.
    <p>
      If you are using BehaviorSpace, note that doing runs in parallel will
      multiply your RAM usage accordingly.
    <p>
    Each platform contains &quot;.cfg&quot; files containing
    JVM settings. There is one cfg file for each sub-application
    (NetLogo, NetLogo 3D, HubNet Client, etc.) Although the file
    location varies by platform, the process for changing it is
    the same. Locate the section of the file that looks like the following:
<pre>
[JVMOptions]
# there may be one or more lines, leave them unchanged
-Xmx1024m
# there may be one or more lines, leave them unchanged
</pre>
    Modify the value immediately following <pre>-Xmx</pre>, changing it
    to the amount of space you need, save the file, and restart NetLogo.
    Platform specific notes follow:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Windows:</b>
        The cfg files will be in
        <pre>C:\Program Files (x86)\NetLogo {{version}}\app</pre>
        if you are running 64-bit windows, and
        <pre>C:\Program Files\NetLogo {{version}}\app</pre>
        otherwise.
      <li>
        <b>Mac OS X:</b>
        The file for NetLogo will be located at:
        <pre>/Application/NetLogo {{version}}/NetLogo.app/Contents/Java/NetLogo.cfg</pre>
        For NetLogo 3D and the other applications, you will find the file
        in the corresponding location for each application package.
        You can reach the cfg file by control-clicking the application
        in the Finder and choosing &quot;Show Package Contents&quot;
        from the popup menu.
        <p>
        Please note that depending on your version of Mac OS X, changing
        the cfg file *may* break application signing. If this happens, follow
        Apple's directions on
        <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">this page</a> to
        temporarily allow apps from "Anywhere", run NetLogo once, then restore
        the setting to "Mac App Store and Identified Developers".
      <li>
        <b>Other:</b>
        The cfg files will be located in the <pre>netlogo-{{version}}/app</pre>
        folder after untarring.
      </ul>
    <p>
    By default, Mac builds of NetLogo bundle a 64-bit JVM, which should
    be able to make use of as much memory as the lesser of available system
    memory and the value following <pre>-Xmx</pre>.
    Windows and Linux will bundle a 32-bit or 64-bit JVM, depending on
    which version you have downloaded. It is recommended that you
    install 64-bit NetLogo on all 64-bit operating systems for best performance.
    <h3>
      Can I use GIS data in NetLogo?
    </h3>
    <p id="gisimport">
      Yes, many users are using GIS data with NetLogo. The most complete
      way to do that is with the GIS extension. See the <a href="gis.html">GIS Extension Guide</a>.
    <p>
      A simpler way is to use <code>import-pcolors</code>, but that only works
      for importing maps that are images, not maps in other formats.
    <p>
      It is also possible to write NetLogo code that reads GIS data using
      our file I/O primitives such as <code>file-open</code>. For example, see
      the Grand Canyon model in the Earth Science section of Sample Models.
    <h3>
      My model runs slowly. How can I speed
      it up?
    </h3>
    <p id="speed">
      Here's some ways to make it run faster without changing the
      structure of the code:
    <ul>
      <li>Use tick-based view updates, not continuous updates.
      <li>Decrease the frequency of view updates by pushing the speed
      slider to the right, or turn updates off using the checkbox.
      <li>If your model is using all available RAM on your computer, then
      installing more RAM should help. If your hard drive makes a lot of
      noise while your model is running, you probably need more RAM.
      <li>Use turtle size 1, 1.5, or 2, as the 2D renderings for these
      sizes are cached by NetLogo. (This only affects graphics speed in the
      2D view, not computation speed.)
      </ul>
    <p>
      In many cases, though, if you want your model to run faster, you may
      need to make some changes to the code. Usually the most obvious
      opportunity for speedup is that you're doing too many
      computations that involve all the turtles or all the patches. Often
      this can be reduced by reworking the model so that it does less
      computation per time step. The members of the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/netlogo-users/">NetLogo Users
      Group</a> may be able to help with this.
    <p>
      The <a href="profiler.html">profiler extension</a> is useful for
      identifying which parts of your code are taking the most time.
    <p>
      Unless you are running the exact same strings over and over, using
      <code>run</code> and <code>runresult</code> are much slower than running code
      directly; you should avoid using these primitives on fresh strings in
      performance-critical code.
    <h3>
      Can I have more than one
      model open at a time?
    </h3>
    <p id="multimodels">
      One instance of NetLogo can only have one model open at a time.
      (Unfortunately, it is unlikely that this will change in a future
      version, due to the engineering difficulties involved.)
    <p>
      You can have multiple models open by opening multiple instances of
      NetLogo, though. On Windows and Linux, simply start the application
      again. On a Mac, you'll need to duplicate the application (not
      the whole folder, just the application itself) in the Finder, then
      open the copy. (The copy takes up only a very small amount of
      additional disk space.)

      My turtle moved forward 1,
      but it's still on the same patch. Why?
    </h3>
    <p id="nextpatch1">
      If you have disabled wrapping at the world edges in your model, then
      the turtle might be at a world edge and unable to move any further.
      You can test for this using <code>can-move?</code>.
    <p>
      Assuming the turtle isn't hitting a world edge, moving forward 1
      is only guaranteed to take a turtle to a new patch if the
      turtle's heading is a multiple of 90 (that is, exactly north,
      south, east, or west).
    <p>
      It's because the turtle might not be standing in the center of a
      patch. It might be near the corner of a patch. For example, suppose
      your turtle is close to the southwest corner of a patch and is facing
      northeast. The length of the patch diagonal is 1.414... (the square
      root of two), so <code>fd 1</code> will leave the turtle near the
      northeast corner of the same patch.
    <p>
      If you don't want to have to think about these issues, one
      possibility is to write your model in such a way that your turtles
      always come to rest on patch centers. See next question.
    <h3>
      How do I keep my turtles
      on patch centers?
    </h3>
    <p id="nextpatch1b">
      A turtle is on a patch center when its <code>xcor</code> and
      <code>ycor</code> are integers.
    <p>
      You can move a turtle to the center of its current patch with either
      of these two equivalent commands:
    <pre>
move-to patch-here
setxy pxcor pycor
</pre>
    <p>
      But you'll never need to do that if you never allow turtles off
      of patch centers in the first place.
    <p>
      The <code>sprout</code> command creates turtles on patch centers. For
      example:
    <pre>
ask n-of 50 patches [ sprout 1 [ face one-of neighbors4 ] ]
</pre>
    <p>
      Another way for a turtle to start on a patch center is with a command
      such as this line of turtle code, which moves it to the center of a
      random patch:
    <pre>
move-to one-of patches
</pre>
    <p>
      Once a turtle is on a patch center, as long as its heading always
      stays an exact multiple of 90 (that is to say, due north, east,
      south, or west), and as it long as it moves forward or back by
      integer amounts, it will always land on patch centers.
    <p>
      See Random Grid Walk Example, in the Code Examples section of the
      Models Library, to see these code snippets in use.
    <h3>
      <code>patch-ahead 1</code> is
      reporting the same patch my turtle is already standing on. Why?
    </h3>
    <p id="nextpatch2">
      See the answer two answers up. It's the same issue.
    <p>
      This might not be the meaning of &quot;ahead&quot; you were
      expecting. With <code>patch-ahead</code>, you must specify the distance
      ahead that you want to look. If you want to know the next patch a
      turtle would cross into if it moved forward continuously, it is
      possible to find that out. See Next Patch Example, in the Code
      Examples section of the Models Library.
    <h3>
      How do I give my turtles
      &quot;vision&quot;?
    </h3>
    <p id="vision">
      You can use <code>in-radius</code> to let a turtle see a circular area
      around it.
    <p>
      Several primitives let the turtle &quot;look&quot; at specific
      points. The <code>patch-ahead</code> primitive is useful for letting a
      turtle see what is directly in front of it. If you want the turtle to
      look in another direction besides straight ahead, try
      <code>patch-left-and-ahead</code> and <code>patch-right-and-ahead</code>.
    <p>
      If you want the turtle to have a full &quot;cone&quot; of vision, use
      the <code>in-cone</code> primitive.
    <p>
      You can also find out the next patch a turtle would cross into if it
      moved forward continuously. See Next Patch Example, in the Code

      It really doesn't matter. Even if 1 were a possible result, it
      would only come up approximately 1 in 2^64 tries, which means
      you'd be waiting hundreds of years before it ever came up exactly
      1.
    <p>
      Nonetheless, if you are convinced that it really must be possible to
      get 1, you can use <code>precision</code> to round your answer to a
      certain number of decimal places. For example:
    <pre>
print precision (random-float 1) 10
0.2745173723
</pre>
    <p>
      (If you use this method, note that 0 and 1 are only half as likely to
      come up as other answers. To see why this is so, consider the case
      where you only keep one digit after the decimal point. Results
      between 0 and 0.5 get rounded to 0, but results between 0.5 and 1.5
      get rounded to 1; the latter range is twice as large. If you want 0,
      0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, and 1 to all be equally likely, an alternative is
      to write <code>random 11 / 10</code>; this gives all 11 answers with
      equal probability.)

      How can I keep
      two turtles from occupying the same patch?
    </h3>
    <p id="twoturtles1patch">
      See One Turtle Per Patch Example, in the Code Examples section of the
      Models Library.
    <h3>
      How can I find out if a turtle is dead?
    </h3>
    <p id="dead">
      When a turtle dies, it turns into <code>nobody</code>. <code>nobody</code> is
      a special value used in NetLogo used to indicate the absence of a
      turtle or patch. So for example:
    <pre>
if turtle 0 != nobody [ ... ]
</pre>
    <p>
      You could also use <code>is-turtle?</code>:
    <pre>
if is-turtle? turtle 0 [ ... ]
</pre>
    <h3>
      Does NetLogo have arrays?
    </h3>
    <p id="arrays">
      Nearly all models should just use lists for this.
    <p>
      The usual motivation for using arrays in other programming languages
      is that they provide fast random access (<code>item</code>) and mutation
      (<code>replace-item</code>). But NetLogo's lists, even though they
      are immutable, now provide near constant time performance on these
      operations.
    <p>
      Lists in earlier versions of NetLogo (4.1 and 4.0) were simple
      singly-linked lists and therefore these operations took linear time.
      The data structure underlying NetLogo's lists now is the
      immutable Vector class from the Scala collections library. It uses
      32-wide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie">hash array
      mapped tries</a>, as implemented by Tiark Rompf, based in part on
      work by Phil Bagwell and Rich Hickey.
    <p>
      If you are certain you want to use raw, mutable JVM arrays in your
      model, they are provided by the array extension. See the Arrays &amp;
      Tables section of the User Manual.
    <h3>
      Does NetLogo have hash
      tables or associative arrays?
    </h3>
    <p id="associative">
      Yes, using the table extension. See the Arrays &amp; Tables section
      of the User Manual.
    <h3>
      How can I use
      different patch &quot;neighborhoods&quot; (circular, Von Neumann,
      Moore, etc.)?
    </h3>
    <p id="neighborhoods">
      The <code>in-radius</code> primitives lets you access circular
      neighborhoods of any radius.
    <p>
      The <code>neighbors</code> primitive gives you a Moore neighborhood of
      radius 1, and the <code>neighbors4</code> primitive gives you a Von
      Neumann neighborhood of radius 1.
    <p>
      For Moore or Von Neumann neighborhoods of a larger radius, see Moore
      &amp; Von Neumann Example in the Code Examples section of the Models
      Library.
    <h3>
      How can I convert an
      agentset to a list of agents, or vice versa?
    </h3>
    <p id="agentsetlist">
      If you want the list in a particular order, use the <code>sort</code> or
      <code>sort-by</code> primitives. The Lists section of the Programming
      Guide explains how to do this. See also Ask Ordering Example, in the
      Code Examples section of the Models Library.
    <p>
      If you want the list in a random order, here's how:
    <pre>
[self] of &lt;agentset&gt;
</pre>
    <p>
      Because all operations on agentsets are in random order, the
      resulting list is in random order.
    <p>
      To convert a list of agents to an agentset, use the
      <code>turtle-set</code>, <code>patch-set</code>, or <code>link-set</code>
      primitives.
    <h3>
      How do I stop foreach?
    </h3>
    <p id="stoppingforeach">
      To stop a foreach from executing you need to define a separate
      procedure that contains only the foreach, for example:
    <pre>
to test
  foreach [1 2 3] [
    if ? = 2 [ stop ]
    print ?
  ]
end
</pre>
    <p>
      This code will only print the number 1. The <code>stop</code> returns
      from the current procedure so nothing after the foreach will be
      executed either. (If the procedure is a reporter procedure, use
      <code>report</code> instead of <code>stop</code>.)
    <h3>
      I'm trying to make a list. Why do I keep getting the error &quot;Expected
      a constant&quot;?
    </h3>
    <p id="listexpectedconstant">
      If a list contains only constants, you can write it down just by
      putting square brackets around it, like <code>[1 2 3]</code>.
    <p>
      If you want your list to contain items that may vary at runtime, the
      list cannot be written down directly. Instead, you build it using the
      <a href="dictionary.html#list">list</a> primitive.

    <h3>
      Why are the rows
      in my BehaviorSpace table results out of order?
    </h3>
    <p id="tableoutoforder">
      This is normal when doing multiple runs in parallel. For a discussion
      of the issue, see the section on parallel runs in the <a href="behaviorspace.html">BehaviorSpace Guide</a> section of the User
      Manual.
    <h3>
      How do I measure runs every n ticks?
    </h3>
    <p id="everynticks">
      Use <code>repeat</code> in your experiment's go commands, e.g.:
    <pre>
repeat 10 [ go ]
</pre>
    <p>
      to measure the run after every 10 ticks. Essentially you are making
      one experiment step equal 10 ticks.
    <h3>
      I'm varying a global
      variable I declared in the Code tab, but it doesn't work. Why?
    </h3>
    <p id="bsglobals">
      It's probably because your setup commands or setup procedure are
      using <code>clear-all</code>, causing the values set by BehaviorSpace to
      be cleared.
    <p>
      One possible workaround is to change your experiment's setup
      commands to preserve the value of the variable, e.g.:
    <pre>
let old-var1 var1
setup
set var1 old-var1
</pre>
    <p>
      This works because even <code>clear-all</code> doesn't clear the
      values of local variables made with <code>let</code>
    <p>
      Another possible workaround is to change your model's setup
      procedure to use more specific clearing commands to clear only what
      you want cleared.

      Why are some of my results cut off
      in Excel?
    </h3>
    <p id="columns">
      In some versions of Excel, spreadsheets can't have more than 256
      columns. (See <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HA010548191033.aspx">a
      Microsoft support article</a> on the subject.)
    <p>
      Possible workarounds include:
    <ul>
      <li>Use a newer version of Excel, such as Excel 2007 (Windows) or
      Excel 2008 (Mac).
      <li>Use a different program besides Excel.
      <li>Ask BehaviorSpace to generate results in table format instead of,
      or in addition to, spreadsheet format. (Excel can read our table
      format, too.)
      <li>Change your experiment so the result has fewer columns.

    <p id="stereo">
      NetLogo supports fullscreen exclusive mode. If that is all your
      device needs then, possibly yes. However, it can be tricky to get it
      working. We don't have any such devices so it is difficult for us
      to make the process easier. If your device needs something else, for
      example, quadbuffers enabled, the answer is probably no.
