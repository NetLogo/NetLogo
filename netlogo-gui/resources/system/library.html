<h2>About the Models Library</h2>

<p><em>Sample Models</em> are the most carefully checked models we have.
They are examples of good coding and documentation practice.
</p>

<p><em>Unverified</em> models are also complete and functional,
but are still in the process of being reviewed for content,
accuracy, and quality of code.
</p>

<p><em>Code Examples</em> are not complete models, but short illustrations
of particular features and coding techniques.  They are a supplement to
the NetLogo User Manual.
</p>

<p><em>Curricular Models</em> are associated with curricula developed at the CCL.
The models also appear, sometimes in different form, in Sample Models.
For information on the curricula, see the CCL home page at
<a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu">http://ccl.northwestern.edu</a>.
</p>

<p>
<em>HubNet Activities</em> are for use with our HubNet participatory simulation architecture.
</p>

<p>
  <em>IABM Textbook</em> models are from: Wilensky, U &amp; Rand, W. (2015). Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling: Modeling Natural, Social and Engineered Complex Systems with NetLogo. Cambridge, MA. MIT Press.
  The models, as well as any updates to them, can also be found on the textbook website: <a href='http://intro-to-abm.com'>http://intro-to-abm.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Alternative Visualizations</em> models demonstrate the application of guidelines presented in: Kornhauser, D., Wilensky, U., &amp; Rand, W. (2009). <a href='http://ccl.northwestern.edu/papers/2009/Kornhauser,Wilensky&Rand_DesignGuidelinesABMViz.pdf'>Design guidelines for agent based model visualization</a>. Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, JASSS, 12(2), 1.

<p>
<em>User Community Models</em>
 are models contributed from the user community to be shared with other NetLogo users.
 They are not included with NetLogo, but are available on the web by pressing the button below.
