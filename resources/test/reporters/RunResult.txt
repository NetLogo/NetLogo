# The error message we get here is a lousy one. The reason it talks about parentheses
# is that Evaluator wraps the code like "to-report foo report (3 die) end".  Without
# parens it would pass the compiler which we definitely don't want, but including
# the parens results it this confusing error message. - ST 11/12/09
