    <h2>
      Known bugs (all systems)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Language/engine
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>export-world</tt> and <tt>import-world</tt> don't save and
        restore the effect of <tt>set-default-shape</tt>.
      <li>
        <tt>import-world</tt> doesn't work on arrays or tables that
        contain other arrays or tables.
      <li>Strings run with the <tt>run</tt> and <tt>runresult</tt>
      primitives are sometimes not able to read or set variables
      created with <tt>let</tt>.
      <li>Not all mathematical operations are checked, so it's possible
      to get &quot;Infinity&quot; or &quot;NaN&quot; (Not a Number) as an
      answer without a runtime error being signaled.
      <li>A bug in Java causes patch colors imported using <a href=
      "dictionary.html#import-pcolors"><tt>import-pcolors</tt></a> to be
      brighter than the original if the original image has a grayscale
      palette. To work around this issue, convert the image file to an RGB
      palette.
      <li>Tasks:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <tt>import-world</tt> cannot import tasks.
          <li>Recompiling the Code tab does not recompile tasks already
          stored in variables.
          </ul>
      </ul>
    <h3>
      Other
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Out-of-memory conditions are not handled gracefully.
      <li>&quot;Snap to Grid&quot; is disabled when zoomed in or out.
      <li>Drawing and then erasing a line in the drawing may not erase
      every pixel exactly.
      <li>The size of the fonts used in a model's interface can vary
      somewhat from computer to computer and from platform. As a result,
      text that fits in a given space on one computer may not fit in
      another. To avoid this problem, it is advisable to leave some extra
      space in the sizes of buttons, sliders, etc.
      <li>When running a model headless (from the command line), if the
      model was created in an earlier NetLogo version, it may not work
      properly. Use the GUI to open and resave the model in the current
      NetLogo version before running it headless.
      </ul>
    <h2>
      Windows-only bugs
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>On some laptops, the Info and Code tabs may become garbled when
      you scroll them. To avoid this bug, reduce the size of the NetLogo
      window and/or reduce the color depth of your monitor (e.g. change
      from 32-bit to 16- or 8-bit color). This is a bug in Java itself, not
      in NetLogo per se. For technical details on the bug, see <a href=
      "http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4763448.html">
        http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4763448.html</a>
        (free registration required). NetLogo users are encouraged to visit
        that site and vote for Sun to fix this bug.
      </ul>
    <h2>
      Mac-only bugs
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When opening a model from the Finder (by double-clicking on it,
      or dragging it onto the NetLogo icon), if NetLogo is not already
      running, then the model may or may not open; the bug is intermittent.
      (If NetLogo is already running, the model always opens.)
      </ul>
    <h2>
      Linux/UNIX-only bugs
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We have discovered a problem on Linux where the <tt>exp</tt>
      reporter sometimes returns a slightly different answer (differing
      only in the last decimal place) for the same input. According to an
      engineer at Sun, this should only happen on Linux kernel versions
      2.4.19 and earlier, but we have observed the problem on more recent
      kernel versions. We assume the problem is Linux-specific and does not
      happen on other Unix-based systems. We are not sure if the problem
      ever occurs in practice during actual NetLogo model runs, or only
      occurs in the context of our testing regimen. The bug in the
      Sun's Java VM, and not in NetLogo itself. We hope that only the
      &quot;exp&quot; reporter is affected, but we can't be entirely
      certain of this. NetLogo users are encouraged to visit <a href=

        http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/5023712.html</a>
        (free registration required) and vote for Sun to fix this bug.
      <li>If NetLogo cannot find the font Lucida, menus will be illegible.
      This has been known to happen on Fedora Core 3, after upgrading
      packages. Restarting the X Font Server (xfs) has resolved the problem
      in all reported cases.
      <li>Under window managers which do not reparent root windows,
      such as DWM, there will be various menu and window drawing
      issues.  Windows may appear blank, and menus may pop-up and
      disappear.  To resolve these issue, please refer to the
      solutions suggested
