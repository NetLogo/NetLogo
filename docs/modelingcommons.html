<p>The Modeling Commons
  (<a href="http://modelingcommons.org/">http://modelingcommons.org/</a>)
  is a Web-based collaboration system for NetLogo modelers.  Users of
  the Modeling Commons can share, download, modify, create variations
  of, comment on, and run NetLogo models -- both those that are a
  part of the NetLogo models library, and also those that have been
  uploaded by other NetLogo users.</p>

<p>By uploading your NetLogo models to the Modeling Commons, you make
  it easy for others to see, review, and comment on your work.  You
  can optionally keep the model private, either to yourself or to a
  group of your choice, if you aren't comfortable with letting
  everyone see the model.  You can always change the permissions
  associated with a model, if you change your mind later on.</p>

<p>NetLogo now makes it possible to save models to the Modeling
  Commons, just as you can save them to <code>.nlogo</code> files on
  your own computer.  You can access this functionality by selecting
  "Upload to Modeling Commons" from the "File" menu, underneath the
  "Save As Applet..." option.</p>

<p>Use of the Modeling Commons is free of charge.  You may use it for
  your own personal work, for your research group or company, or for a
  class in which you are a student or teacher.  The Modeling Commons
  is sponsored by the CCL, the same group that develops and
  distributes NetLogo.</p>

</h2>

<p><img src="images/modelingcommons/login.jpg" alt="Log in to Modeling Commons"></p>

<p>In order to upload models to the Modeling Commons, you must first
  be a registered user.  Unregistered users can view and download
  models, but cannot upload, edit, or comment on them.</p>

<p>The first time that you invoke "Save to Modeling Commons" in
  NetLogo, you will be prompted to enter your e-mail address and
  password.  If you already have an account, then you can enter this
  information and click on the "Login" button.</p>

<p>If you don't yet have an account with the Modeling Commons, then
  you will need to create one.  Click on the "Create Account" button,
  and enter the requested information.  Once you have done so, click
  on the "Create Account" button.  If there are no errors, then you
  will be prompted to upload a NetLogo model.  Alternatively, you may
  go to <a href="http://modelingcommons.org/">the Modeling Commons
    itself</a> and register with your Web browser.</p>

<h2>
  <a name="upload" id="upload">Uploading Models</a>
</h2>

<p>There are three ways to upload a model to the Modeling Commons:
  Uploading, updating, and creating a child ("forking").  The
  following sections describe these in detail.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="new_model" id="new_model">Upload A New Model</a>
</h3>


<p>A new model will be created in the Modeling Commons, with its own
  page, description, and forum.  You should use this function the
  first time that you save a model to the Modeling Commons.</p>


<p>
  <img src="images/modelingcommons/newmodel.jpg" alt="Uploading a new model">

<p>
  You must give your model a name.  Model names are not required
  to be unique; you could have 2 or more models with the same
  name, though we recommend that you not do this.</p>

<p>By default, anyone can view, fork, and update your model.  You can
  restrict the ability to view and fork your model by changing the
  visibility permission.  You can restrict the ability to update your
  model by changing the changeability permission. In order to set
  permissions for multiple people, assign your model to a group, and
  then restrict visibility or changeability to members of that group.
  Groups can be created from the
  <a href="http://modelingcommons.org/account/groups#group_tabs_new_group">Modeling
    Commons</a>. Once you have uploaded your model, you can edit the
  permissions from the model's Modeling Commons page.</p>

<p>You can optionally upload a preview image to your model.  The
  preview image will be displayed alongside your model whenever it is
  shown on the Modeling Commons. While uploading a preview image is
  optional, we highly recommend that you do so, in one of the
  following three ways:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The "Use current image" option tells NetLogo to use the current
    view as your preview.  We recommend that you first run the model,
    such that it shows off the key visual features.</li>

  <li>The "Auto-generate image" feature auto-generates a preview image
    by running <code>random-seed 0 setup repeat 75 [ go ]</code>.  This
    option will only be enabled if you have defined <code>setup</code>
    and <code>go</code> procedures for NetLogo to run.</li>

  <li>The "Image from file" feature allows you to upload any PNG image.
    Preview images work best when they are square.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
  <a name="child_model" id="child_model">Upload A Child Of An Existing
    Model ("forking")</a> 
</h3>

<p>Saving a model in this way, sometimes known as "forking," does not
  change or overwrite the original model.  Rather, it creates a new
  model on the Modeling Commons, much as a plain "save" would do,
  simultaneously creating a parent-child relationship between the old
  model and the new one.  This relationship can be seen on the
  "family" tab for a given model.  You may fork any model for which
  you have "view" permissions, including one that you cannot change.
  You may wish, for example, to create a variation on a model in the
  NetLogo models library.</p>

<p>
  <img src="images/modelingcommons/childmodel.jpg" alt="Uploading a child of an existing model">

<p>To fork a model, you must give your new child a name, as well as
  select an existing model to fork.  To indicate the existing model,
  start typing the name of the model that you would like to fork.
  Select its name from among the search results.</p>

<p>Finally, you must enter a description about what you are changing
  in your child model, and how it relates to its parent.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="new_version_of_model" id="new_version_of_model">Updating An Existing Model</a>
</h3>

<p>Use this option if you have improved a model that already exists in
  the Modeling Commons.  Existing attachments, discussions, and social
  tags will be preserved, but the model that users can display, run,
  and download will be updated.  You may only update a model for which
  you have "write" permissions.</p>

<p>All versions of a model are saved in the Modeling Commons, so you
  should feel free to experiment with new ideas.  If something goes
  wrong, you can always refer to an old version from the "history" tab
  on a model's page.</p>

<p>To indicate which model should be updated, start typing the name of
  the model. Select the name that pops up with the search results.
  Finally, enter a description about what you are changing in your new
  version.</p>
