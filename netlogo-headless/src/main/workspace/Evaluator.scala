  // At present (October 2012) this is only used in the slider constraint code, which has been known
  // since we wrote it not to handle threading correctly.  It hasn't been fixed because the feature
  // (reporters as slider bounds) is relatively little known and little used.  This code might
  // actually be correct if called from the job thread, but actually, the current slider code
  // doesn't do that, it calls it from the event thread.  The event thread should not be running
  // NetLogo code; submitting jobs through the job manager is supposed to be the only way that
  // NetLogo code is ever run.  Fixing it wouldn't be easy because the event thread is not allowed
  // to block waiting for the job thread to finish something, since this may cause deadlock.  (And
  // not just in theory either; it definitely deadlocks in practice.)  So, consider this code
  // to have a big "beware" sign on it -- it shouldn't be called from the event thread, but it
  // isn't actually known whether it works when called from the job thread, either.
  //
  // Note that this code is very similar to the ProcedureRunner code above, which is used by
  // plotting.  That code, I believe to be correct and to handle threading correctly.  But the
  // snippets of code in plots are always commands, never reporters, so the plotting stuff never
  // needs makeReporterThunk. - ST 10/9/12
