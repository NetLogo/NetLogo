# You can list extra "variants" of a model to test in this file.
# Lines that start with `*` are expected to have a model path, the same
# as it would appear in the checksums.txt (or headless/3d) file.  The
# non-empty, non-comment lines that follow will each be treated as NetLogo
# commands that define the variant.
