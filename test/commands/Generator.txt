# this is purely temporary -- while I'm still building the new
# compiler it's handy to have a smaller set of language tests here
# instead of the full TestReporters/TestCommand suites - Forrest

# Still, why not keep these around just as a handy, small set of easy
# tests, as a first hurdle for any compiler changes to jump.  Note
# that it's mostly just reporters, but a few commands too. - ST 4/6/08
